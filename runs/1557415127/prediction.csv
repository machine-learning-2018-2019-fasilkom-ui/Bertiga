"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience i 've ever had in any game , ever we 're on our way to the objective , a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces i'm leading a team of 4 men we come to a crossroad and i sprint across , telling my men to hold back i cross a few more times , trying to get a response from any snipers nothing i run , my lmg gunner runs , my medic runs but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure we 'd make it across anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through \? remember the sniper scene \? the marksman takes a round in the leg as we 're running and goes down he then takes two more in the chest the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills , he played it up to 11 here he screams as he 's being shot crawling , drenched in his own blood sarge \? you ain't leaving me out here like this , right \? i i wanna go with you guys ! c'mon sarge , h help me ! c'mon ! please don't leave me ! he died after that i cried and he respawned 11 10 , would recommend getting",1.0
"this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming , this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf , experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower , i was squad leader of 8 or so ai s as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth , no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain , keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk , and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern , i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower , all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure , if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back , as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back , hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell , from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission , not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about",1.0
"oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter , as it is so , so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of , and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform , upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though , arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning , the gameplay is excellent , the mechanics are solid , and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series \( as i was \) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fps shooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief , brutal , and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no mini maps , no enemy ui icons indicators , no hit markers , no health bars if you get shot a couple of times , you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players , it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness , cover , teamwork , suppressive fire , and generally moving purposefully and as if your depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles , armor , helicopters , and planes , each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master , and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box , arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts , each containing 12 15 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding , and challenging \( i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete \) however the single player campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions , all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer , oh god the multiplayer wasteland , king of the hill , invade and annex , battle royale , breaking point , so many co op opportunities , the amazing looking upcoming epoch \( currently in closed alpha \) im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 , you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review , arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come , and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later \( if you do not find my review helpful , please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback \)",1.0

"i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer , not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games , similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10 20 minutes in a single location \( sometimes longer , i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour \) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great , the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible \( unless doing paintballing or airgunning \) , and if you do buy the game i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game",1.0

"if you 're coming to arma 3 as an arma series veteran , you already know what to expect for the most part , the game has n't changed since the last installment , but then it 's always felt a little bit like bohemia interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by operation flashpoint , in the world 's longest ever game of 'development buckaroo' thankfully , the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner it 's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now arma has a reputation it 's known to be frighteningly obtuse , bewilderingly complex , and often hilariously broken i can tell you right now that arma 3 is no different , and absolutely still deserves that reputation thankfully , i do n't think it 's unfair to say that this is the closest an arma game has come to being 'user friendly' the controls have been tweaked , and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes for these improvements alone , i do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry coming from any other modern fps game , it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls , but i honestly think arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games at the time of writing , the elephant in the room is the lack of content available when compared to arma 2 \( which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs \) , the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim in many cases , opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best for anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in arma 2 , arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing fortunately , this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community it has long been the case that the best parts of the arma games are the parts not developed by bohemia interactive themselves , and arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition' nevertheless , i ca n't help but feel that the game could 've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release speaking of the mod community , i think it 's criminal that almost none of the best , near indispensible mods from arma 2 have been officially integrated for a self professed 'war simulator' , arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces \( even with a visible bipod \) , or tow damaged vehicles for all its flaws , though , arma 3 is still a blast to play if you can find a decent group of like minded gamers with access to a voice over net server , you 're in for some of the best gaming you 'll ever experience sure , you 'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety and sure , sometimes the game will crash spectacularly , or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall but when you 're standing on a hilltop , looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a cas helicopter strafes an enemy apc and spots targets for a distant sniper team when everything clicks together in the way that only arma can manage , you 'll be glad to have been along for the ride",1.0

"being an avid arma 2 wasteland dayz player back in the day \( about 1 5 years ago \) , i relished the thought of a new arma coming out arma 2 was practically uknown until it 's popularity was increased by dayz i found it interesting to jump into a bi \( bohemia interactive \) title that already had a steady fan base behind it having been about a year since i purchased this game \( launch \) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay i feel that i can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects i have experienced within this game now i know what you 're thinking 59 99 \? ! this is n't even considered a triple a title ! that 's like that 's like the price of cod ghosts ! now , do n't be intimidated by this price , for i can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than 59 99 from a value perspective , i found the price to be very reasonable based on the game 's content nowadays basically , arma is a series of hardcore military simulation constantly reflecting real world conditions into a video game in arma 2 , i feel that this was it 's drawback , for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration \( breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall it 's a game guys , relax \) arma 3 has found a good balance between an fps 3rd person shooter game and realism , making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator and a game i also found that arma 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun i imagine it is much easier to get into arma 3 than i did arma 2 \( i ca n't judge , i'm not new to it \) the engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the arma 2 engine , however rocks are still \( and i guess forever will be \) broken perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un even surface pro tip never walk on rocks unless you absolutely have to the game also has a variety of content although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are a lot less guns this is partly due to the customization of guns instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation \( m4a1 holo , m4a1 cco , m4a1 \) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights , lasers , silencers , flashlights , what have you however , this is not a full excuse i feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall guns to shoot perhaps bohemia interactive is trying to fine tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety 's sake what 's also very surprisingly good in this game is the nvidia physx that was incorporated seeing my transport truck 's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while i drive troops through the night is oh so satisfying as well as , well realistic ! the physics engine has been extremely improved and i quite like it i 'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound , for this is after all , a big part of the game once again i will compare it to arma 2 , in saying clearly that arma 2 featured a more high pitched tappy sound when you shot with vertical recoil , while 3 brings a much more deeper , louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards the guns definitely feel better for me , but in the end i 'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference lastly , the gamemodes of arma 3 are diverse and excellent , my favourite being wasteland script i wo n't go into detail here there is also king of hill , dayz \( of course , but it 's meh \) and of course standard operations altis life is also a really sweet one ! check those out if you end up buying so yeah , i really like this game and i think that there is so much potential for a growing community grab some buddies , hop into stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad ! really great game , i 'd definitely recommend to any fps milsim fan ! d",1.0

"arma 3 is a tricky game to review , but heres me trying it anyway the reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player i take arma 3 for what it is first and foremost a platform what you get is a good looking game with a solid \( would be great , but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance \) engine , two amazing maps \( stratis and altis , which is probably the most impressive map ive seen in any open world ish game \) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community what you dont get is an easy to get into mil shooter with cod sized maps and a quick pace if youre in for uncomplicated , fast paced pvp gameplay , you should probably look elsewhere if youre sick of that , however , arma 3 might be just your thing the strength of the arma series is freedom \( yeah \) you are free to mod the game into almost anything you want , create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience you have to invest some time into the game , but once you got into it , the opportunities are endless want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more \? arma is just your thing and there are big communities \( in many different languages \) that will help you find that epic experience want to play singe player \? well , if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on , then arma 3 isnt the game youre looking for or is it \? right now bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign those missions are challenging , offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but dont expect a good story or interesting characters but as mentioned before the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime personally i prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2 5 players so , should you buy arma 3 \? well , id certainly recommend it , if any of the things i mentioned above sounds fun to you it is to say though , that this game is not something that everyone might like , so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it i hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by arma 3 please note that im not a native english speaker , so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some",1.0

"while the animations , graphics , lighting , and vehicle handling are better in this installment into the arma series , i miss the arma 2 's setting , units , and mods arma 3 's future istic setting does n't make sense , and some of the gear used just looks flat out odd while i appreciate the new vehicles such as the mrap hunter or the newly updated ghosthawk \( blackhawk \) , or any of that sort of updated feel i'm not saying change is a bad thing , i'm just saying sometimes too much change is n't a great addition to the arma series , was the much requested stances available to you during the game whether it 's leaning from standing , crouching , or even laying on your side in the prone position , it offers a wide variety of heights and angles to tackle those pesky rocks , windows , and walls that you 're either too short or too tall for there are 3 standing stances , 3 crouching stances , a sitting position , and a prone position every stance except for sitting , allows you to step out to the side , or lean around cover from the prone , you can peak a corner , or lay on your side this vastly improves over arma 2 's restricted movement it would be nice to see the ability to vault over short walls , or help your buddy boost over a larger one as well , but that 's just wishful thinking another thing i noticed , is the sound of the weapons a lot of the weapons have similar sounds , which makes it hard to distinguish which side of the battle you 're getting into while some of the sounds such as explosions , vehicles , and other small ambient additions are nice , i feel like i'm often confused and lost with the sounds hopefully , a good soundmod will fix this later down the road ai ai ai one thing the arma series has n't been able to nail down , is the ai 's movement , pathing , communication , and skills i realize that it 's really difficult in such a complex and vast game such as this , where the player has free will on which direction to get to an objective , or how , but often you 'll either find your allies falling behind , running out of formation for a second , or asking where are you after you run over a hill even though other soldiers under your command are still coming of the hill themselves it would be nice to see ai being able to figure out things based on other ai , and not almost strictly from you combat awareness something i noticed in arma , is that no matter what situation , the ai in combat are lacking , whether an enemy soldier , or a friendly , you 'll notice them not finding cover , running into the middle of a street , or from behind cover out into the open on one of my first showcase missions , i was instructed by my ai squad leader to move behind a wrecked tank as cover neat i thought he then gave me an area to suppress , as i was an automatic rifleman i began laying fire down from my position , my own squad leader walked next to me , and as he gave an order , ran right in front of me , bushing me back , and causing a bullet to hit him in the head , resulting in a mission failed and having to restart the whole thing note , the time it took for him to stand next to me and rush in front of me was almost 1 second , leaving me no time to react their aim is n't that great either you could be standing across a room and they wo n't be able to hit you , or they 'll be firing from a fortified position catching you and your allies of guard yet , not hiting any of you as you sprint to cover or dash towards it now , this goes both ways to combat them being too easy , you could set the dificulty to expert of veteran the problem with this , is that the change is too extreme setting your game to the highest difficulty , results in enemy soldiers being able to spot you easily you could be concealed at night in a bush , and taking you out that , or you 'll witness getting shot in the head from across the valley my advice \? find some friends or a group to join , disable ai teammates for the mission , and only play with a team made up of human players , 9 times out of 10 , you 'll be able to accurately cover teammates , move together in a more realistic and effective way , and it will increase your expierence 10 fold here 's an example of the helo ai in this game http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails \? id 203646487 another weird problem you may notice , is the problem with framerates while playing any form of multiplayer you may or many not have issues , and to top it off , it 's really sporatic and without a known cause in singleplayer however , this is not the case , and the game runs a lot smoother and it is quite confusing , and frustrating when trying to set your settings here 's an example you go to singleplayer , and you set your game to just the right settings after a while of tinkering the game looks great , and you 're real happy with it now your friend hops on , or you want to go play on a server you select one with the best player ping ratio , and join it you notice right away your frames are a lot worse , and you sit the tinkering with your settings again , mostly lowering everything so that you can run the game not only does this make the game look worse in one of the most important features of the game , but when you join back to singleplayer , the game looks worse , and you either have to deal with the settings again , or get stuck with lower graphics now , changing the settings in multiplayer may not always fix the problem either , so you could be messing with them for awhile before giving up in frustration overall if you 're a fan of the arma series , or any realistic shooter , i 'd go for arma 3 while i still play arma 2 more , arma 3 offers enough change when i get tired of the former improved graphics and lighting , vehicle handling , weapon handling , and the use of different combat stances , really improves over arma 2 's static and prohibited movement while you wo n't be in the deserts of takistan , or going through the dense city of zargabad , the islands of stratis and altis , are sure to give you the variety and fun you 'd want while the ai is n't improved much , some of the futuristic units , and factions do n't fit well , and the sounds can tend to be confusing , arma 3 is definitely a step in the right direction , and a giant leap towards success",1.0

"arma 3 is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players the many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series , while seasoned vets will feel right at home \( for better or worse \) there is a great deal to learn about playing arma in a way that is enjoyable the default campaign mode is passable , with all the tropes you 'd expect to find in a military shooter , with a few surprises here and there missions vary in length and scope , ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults however , where the real meat is in the multiplayer experience and the many mods available hopping on to a co op server with 60 players who actually want to work together as a unit is nothing short of amazing in a world of le epic trelling being able to request evac , mortar , medical assistance , etc is wonderous on it 's own , but having those assets being controlled by actual players gives you a sense of connection and being part of a team even if realistic military games are n't your particular style , there are plenty of other game modes available that you can download right from the server browser and enjoy these include standouts like altis life \( kind of like a more advanced cops and robbers \) , wasteland \( a survival mod focused on factions \) , and breaking point \( a day z style mod \) mods will breath all sorts of new life into your game , adding new vehicles , uniforms , maps and much much more , giving you almost limitless scenarios and tools to use in creating custom missions you can check out the large database of mods at http www armaholic com that said , arma is not without it 's fair number of faults and missteps , the game is not optimized well for multiplayer , and you 'll encounter many bugs along the way \( most of which are hilarious as opposed to annoying \) the learning curve can be fairly steep , and you 'll have to be patient to get the most fun out of this title that said , it 's well worth it , especially if you have some friends willing to do the same",1.0

"it 's the dead of night on the csat occupied island of stratis , and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos i'm leading one of two spec ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of altis a british squad is in charge of the actual rescue our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the csat forces and give the british the opening they need over the next hour , that 's precisely what i do inserting by boat from the northwest coast , i head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as i swoop in from the west to flank them yet before we can regroup , my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north , and the british still need more time to complete their mission alone , i rush to the southernmost tip of the island , where i blow up a fortified anti air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point , where the boat takes me home arguably the biggest complaint about bohemia interactive 's post flashpoint games is that their campaigns have n't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential the first arma 's campaign was a hastily cobbled together disappointment , while it took a certain zombie survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of arma 2 's chernarus that arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty odd missions is indicative of bohemia 's effort to resolve this ongoing issue indeed , taken as a whole , arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive , more engaging and more user friendly experience it is n't completely successful , but i had an awful lot of fun watching it try while arma 3 was officially released back in september , the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months each chapter is a self contained entity with its own story arc and theme combined , they tell the tale of the excitingly named corporal ben kerry and his role in the war over the fictional mediterranean island archipelago of altis and stratis , waged between four different factions the first part , survive , is geared towards introducing players to arma it takes place entirely on the smaller of arma 3 's two islands , stratis , and sees kerry banding up with a group of nato survivors after the local altian armed forces , backed by nato 's eastern equivalent csat , rise up against the local us garrison for the most part , missions are small scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the follower category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position , while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings it 's hardly the campaign 's most spectacular stage story wise , it 's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another even here , though , bohemia 's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent missions are nearly always multi staged , with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan while it smoulders rather than sparks , survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into adapt , definitely the best of the three chapters this introduces altis , a masterwork of environmental design i could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds its misty dawns , crimson dusks and streetlight speckled nights but what 's most important is how the detail that 's gone into mapping the landscape 's undulations the lumps and bumps , hills and valleys plays into the game 's combat a little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy ai when they stop to reload , you 'll rush to locate a better vantage point , order your men to find cover \( an extremely handy new command \) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent 's surprisingly tough body tactics are vital in arma 3 , but it 's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure it 's crucial to learn this before adapt begins , because the difficulty suddenly ramps up the first mission sees you alone , unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety at this point , setting saves to unlimited using arma 's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity fittingly , after survive , you will die many , many times that said , it 's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations , smoother weapon handling and better optics meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow to aim weapons adapt also changes the way you play it gives you a squad to control , which is a mixed blessing ai units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and apcs , but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive , and the lack of changes to arma 's squad commands means this can be a chore especially problematic is ai ammo management your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop , and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in arma 3 's clumsy interface alongside its story missions , which include the brilliant raid on stratis described above , adapt also introduces an open world component from your base you can go out on patrol and complete multiple optional objectives , from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex , all while collecting weapons , ammo and equipment to use during the main missions though the clunkiness of arma 's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be if you want to bring stuff back to base , you need to find a vehicle and load it item by item from your own inventory , while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process after the meatiness of adapt , the final chapter win feels fleeting by comparison , with only six missions to its name but they 're also the most spectacular , displaying vast , combined arms battles that cover sweeping areas of altis it 's strongly reminiscent of the opening of operation flashpoint , but with you in control rather than being led by an ai squad leader in these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults , simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things story wise , it 's also the most interesting segment , making unsettling use of its near future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating , whichever direction you take arma 3 's campaign is a big , powerful , deeply engrossing thing , but there is one disappointment its lack of vehicular missions since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt , there are no tank missions , no helicopter missions and no jet missions i can understand why , to a point arma 's vehicles , especially its airborne offering , take time and effort to learn to control moreover , in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway on the other hand , flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue , and it 's frustrating that , 13 years on , arma 's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience",1.0

"this game features a lot more than it may seem it 's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over everytime you play will be a different experience , may it be your role , the difficulty , or the ai it 's all different every time you can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it 's not really game breaking , it 's just a moment you can laugh about plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable , there 's so much different changes you can do to the game , from changing your character 's voice or face , up to making a whole addon and even more im not gonna say the game 's completely perfect though the main problem may be the community , but from time to time you 'll not meet with that problem some people will be nice to you and help you if you 're a newbie to the game , and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare , as people dont appreciate them on the servers the gameplay now that is one hard question to answer the gameplay mostly matters about you , and the gamemode , how you want to play , will still be valid , but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you 'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he 's only using a simple rifle with no scope as you would guess , another problem is the ai , sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it 's just the best ai you can find in a game now , im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it 's better to find out yourselves , but i 'll just say that king of the hill , wasteland \( mostly fun with friends \) , and zeus \( you 'll be most likely to spend days on this one \) are the ones i recommend the community the community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and or experience i'm not gonna say much about it except this but there 's alot you can say about the community the engine this game requires a beefy pc \( currently at its state \) but the engine is brilliant , it can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard cpu usage the engine is mostly dependant rather more on the ram than the cpu , i recommend atleast 6 12 ram for this game if you 're gonna play it alot overall the game 's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it , altough you will find mostly funny moments and non serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable certain people refer to this as a walking simulator but the point is that arma iii is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms , you will find yourself walking and running alot to objectives , but that 's how it is in real life too the game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming you can find alot to do in this like commanding ai and or players , which is always hard at the start , and participating in large assaults on towns such as kavala in my opinion , arma iii is worth a shot lankercool , commander and soldier , also regular zeus player in the arma iii community",1.0

"the good this game is actually the 4th installment of the arma series and i 've been playing since the start the developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game they keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom real virtuality engine rather than replacing it , as well as adding new campaigns , missions , vehicles , weapons , and game modes the part where this game really shines , however , is the community driven mods the game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make anything they want out of this game it may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page , but i 've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims , grand theft auto like games \( arma life \) , hardcore zombie games \( dayz \) , a stargate tribute which had working , animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show , ww2 sims \( invasion 1944 \) , jurassic park tributes , and so much more these mods take a lot of work to create , sure , but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down now add some waypoints for them to attack a town add some soldiers inside the town that 's it ! if you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers , using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy this all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on want to do more \? read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you 'll have the ability to make suicide bombers , battle busses \( essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it \) , nuclear bombs , and really anything you can imagine if you have any issues , someone will be willing to help you out either on reddit com r armadev or on the official bohemia interactive forums i hope you 'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or i just freshly made in the editor ! even if you do n't like making your own content , there are fun mods already out there such as the popular battle royale mod where you 're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear just look around and you 'll find endless entertainment in this game ! the bad i mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced this does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games , but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs another warning i would give would be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your pc people who have rigs that they think are powerful because they can play battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware at the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware , even when pretty impressive , just does n't get along with the game that well at the moment",1.0

"very addictive i would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in depth military sandbox shooter this game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat before i get any farther into this review , i would like to point out that this game is nothing like cod or battlefield that does n't necessarily mean it ca n't be fast paced , but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some i'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay , rather than go in depth with mods overall gameplay 9 10 this game is often called a walking simulator , however this game is so much more than that once you play long enough , you just look at walking as another method of travel you start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives other players do you want to risk driving to a location , only to get blown up by at \( anti tank \) or would you rather take the longer , but mostly safer method of walking once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk that being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure this is perhaps one of favorite things about this game want to stealthily insert from the sea seal style \? would you rather set up on a hill 1 5km away and pick off the enemy \? or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path the decision is ultimately yours you may find that a lot of this is n't in the vanilla game , but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more combat 8 10 combat is great , but it has its problems \( some very frustrating problems at that \) pvp combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics however the ai is ridiculous it has gotten better overtime , but the ai is completely unpredictable sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off , or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off , only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim do n't let that ruin your experience though some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the ai doing something completely hilarious \( ex taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason \) mechanics 9 10 falls 2 feet to the ground , dies to be fair combat mechanics in arma 3 are much better imo than that of previous arma titles bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done it can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the 50 cal lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles bullet spread drop seems realistic enough if your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you 'll be mostly dissappointed , but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little there are lots of options for movement and stances \( they can actually benefit you greatly in combat \) i highly recommend staying away from rocks i have no idea why , but rocks can instakill trap you if your not careful not all rocks are like this , mostly just large ones stay away visuals 9 10 when first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking for the full experience i would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume the immersion is very enjoyable if you ca n't run the game on ultra dont feel left out it still looks great , and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online \( being able to see through foilage fog \) there 's probably a lot i could add to this review , but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods there are too many good ones to list i may sound a little biased because i love this game so much , but if the above that i described sounds remotely like something your interested in then i highly recommend it",1.0
"the most comprehensive military sim out there , setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons , vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for the game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original operation flashpoint , released over 10 years ago however , of all the iterations , arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most these are n't big changes , but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth graphically , it 's convincing it is n't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel alive you can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on \( yup , it is a real place \) if you do n't know anything about this game , the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic' you are a single soldier in a large , real time conflict you can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead do n't expect to behave like rambo and to survive i would n't consider this game 'complete' just yet for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing , the main campaign is only 1 3 released that being said , it 's the community that really supports this game mods like dayz show how flexible and open ended the game can be really , arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support , letting the community come up with the best content personally , i have n't spent much time in the large scale multiplayer side of things i prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own i 've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island yup , on my own , with no npcs or other players i love the sights and sounds i love exploring over the next mountain , or lounging about on a beach , soaking up the digital rays i do n't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and i chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment i could extract from it the community is what makes this product what it is they 're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come you 'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team worthy fashion and thanks to the steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer buying this game is an investment the developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must have title , though it could take several years to reach that stage do n't expect gameplay that 's easy to jump in to , nor should you expect a fun standalone experience but this game is no cod by default it 's not a mainstream game , but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless",1.0
"arma iii arma iii is like chess out of all the table games , arma is the most sofisticated and fancy war game there is i 've had over 2 , 000 hours of battlefield , and of call of duty few hours in insurgency and many other games but arma , i 've never heard of arma iii until one of my friends told me about it , in arma , the systems are extremely advanced , the system is so realistic that it gets up to a point in which it turns plain annoying you break your leg , you ca n't breath , you fall , you trip , you die , you drown , everything happens in this game theres everything that a war game needs to have this is not even a war game , it 's a war simulator which makes it even better the campaign is hours of fun and entertainment , and if you dare , you can even learn how to code in arma and make your own missions , making missions to be rated , for your own fun , to screw around you can do anything you could imagine in few hours , and those few hours will grant you limitless fun , hours and hours of gameplay hours and hours of designing and meeting new people hours and hours of coop , pvp , tdm , ava , and everything that a war simulator needs cars , tanks , planes , boats , submarines , civilian cars , trucks , convoys , war helicopter , transport , ambulances huge maps , huge buildings , huge cities , beautiful physics and beautiful enviroments the map is huge and it would probably take you hours to go across it , both stratis and altis i have n't played this game for a really long time , but , with the very few hours i played , i can pretty much say that it 's way better than anything else i 've ever tried bohemia interactive might not be the best company out there , but still , they made this one beautiful game that no other company have , or ever will , do better you 'll need a team , you 'll need to cooperate , and think about what cards to play while being in the front of the battle , you 'll need to set up your equipment and gear , and know , know how to use it , and how to react to all possible situations this game has no boundaries , and i have great expectations for it , i am waiting for it to grow even more , and for it , to be even , more enjoyable this game , this game is unique this is the best game i 've ever played",1.0

"arma 3 was highly anticipated by me when it was first announced and i pounced on the beta as soon as it was released now that its on general release i'm totally wrapped by it i 've already played around 250 hours and just ca n't get enough of it there 's 114 pages of custom made missions available for free via steam and the armaholic web site , \( singleplayer , coop and multiplayer missions \) http www armaholic com most that i 've played have been excellent the in game editor enables you to create missions fairly easily with little experience the whole package is well worth full price there 's more big updates coming soon adding to the campaign mode the only downside i 've found is the lack of an armoury all previous arma games have included an armoury , where you are able to try out all weapons and vehicles , plus play as any character in game \( including animals \) the game has amazing graphics , an open world stretching for many kilometers in all directions and smooth gameplay all of which make arma a pleasure to play imo far better than any other shooter around \( incluing battlefield 4 , call of duty op flashpoint \) \( love battlefied and the op flashpoint games as well \) edit april 13th 2015 the game has come a long way since i wrote my review , though due to a massive back log of unplayed games that i own , i 've not had much opportunity to play the game recently that said , the developers have added a lot more to the game since last played it , such as the single player campaign , plus of course there are many more missions and modifications added since i mentioned it previously in fact far more than i 'll ever be able to get through",1.0

"it 's difficult to compare arma to another game since it 's so unique the gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and does n't play like a traditional fps console gamers will have no issues with this game 's controls even as their first shooter on a pc arma has a slight learning curve , it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls but they are n't vital for successful gameplay arma is only as complex as you want it to be even though it is a simulation game , it feels much more natural to play than other simulations singleplayer the story is actually pretty good , some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging op flashpoint feel to it which i'm a fan of it 's divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters , each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle there 's also a bootcamp mini campaign which will help new players a lot multiplayer and community arma is a great game to play alone , it 's even better together there 's lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the co op scenario invade and annex , as well as the pvp scenarios such as koth and wasteland but the best experience is playing with an organized group there are casual co op groups , pvp clans as well as hardcore roleplaying milsim units you can feel around for what 's right for you editor arma has always had a very powerful mission editor tool and has open support for custom scripts this alone is all we needed to make missions then bi gave us zeus an in game editor , look up some videos this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself now bi has also promised a 3d mission editor to cover even finer details mods the game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just as is but really it 's whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content the community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and bi has always been highly supportive of community content \( even to the point of cash giveaways from the make arma not war competition \) if you can think of something cool to add to arma , it 's probably already got a download link criticism although the game engine gets some flak for being unoptimized \( bi has been improving on the game 's performance significantly \) when you think about it , how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay \? you can be infantry \( even fight underwater with certain assault rifles \) , skydive halo jump , pilot a transport chopper , fly a jet , drive a tank , use artillery , anything not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap what other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics \? yea , thought so dlc arma 3 's dlc is optional , and you can just get modded content which are not affected even if you do n't buy the dlcs you 'll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who has does n't have dlc just wanted to clear up the myths of arma 3 's dlc i 've been playing since the alpha beta with 1 , 000 online hrs and i'm still not bored arma 3 and arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and bi listens and improves from community feedback arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now it 's been almost 2 years since the alpha was released , and expect arma 3 to be active for at least another 3 5 years , probably more think about it , why buy a bunch of other games when arma can be all of them for one price \? definitely the most well spent money i 've ever spent on a game for the enjoyment i 've gotten so far and will continue to have no doubt about it i'm glad i could support such an awesome studio , keep up the great work bi",1.0

"arma 3 is a lot of fun i say this as someone who enjoys the following elements in games that i devote a lot of time to extensive , detailed cooperative play , and realism immersion if you 're going to arma looking to play the next counterstrike or whatever , you 're going to walk away disappointed arma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter , and yes , there is wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox , and arma 2 had dayz \( which let 's face it , is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies \) , but to get the most out of an arma game , you need to approach it for its strengths the simulation aspect you can play solo as a member of a squad \( depending on the mission finding good missions can be a little tricky \) , or command ai using some non traditional , but with some practice , easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game in multiplayer , coop is king in my opinion , but you can have large scale team vs team pvp which is a lot of fun as well i admin a server that runs a large scale coop mission 24 7 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the ai is smart enough in arma games to allow for emergent gameplay they 'll flank , they 'll fall back , they 'll improvise , and it 's different every time and you have to think the engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter , but arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other bohemia games have been being different is n't a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though if you 're used to other games or approach it like a shooter , you might be annoyed with it , but if you give it time and learn it \( and i ca n't stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it \) , it 's hard to put down some of the best gaming experiences i 've had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people , and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot treat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved , not like a counterstrike of dutyfield alike also steam sale so why the hell not \?",1.0

"after playing many hours on arma iii , from a realistic perspective and a fun one it is a great experience for anyone who loves military simulators en wikipedia org the game is divded into several categories if you will infantry , airborne , waterborne , artillery , armoured , mechanized and hq it covers all of the basics \( plus advanced \) on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself personally , i prefer being behind a console managing uavs ugvs ! the successor of arma ii has certainly taken on the role of nextgen and demolished competition such as america 's army and dcs world the rv4 engine arma3 com is used for dayz standalone and arma 3 thus far though dayz developers have recently announced the change of their heavily modified engine , it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of arma iii to life the detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most in the majority of games i have experienced during my past , graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as call of duty , \( some \) battlefield games and even arma ii the level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of arma iii is insanely good pros detailed , well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors csat , nato , fia , guerillas and even civilians realistic sound effects for particular weapons , majority of them being rifles and pistols ability to perform one of many roles armour , infantry , etcetera well established storyline for the campaign even split into acts for more development time realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the ifv 6c panther when moving over rough terrain , there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world excellent detail ! generally great game to play many , many more cons ladders are extremely buggy climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder artificial intelligence needs a rework their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting earlier today i told my men to hold fire yet they continued , even when disengaged no built in immersive radios external mods required task force arrowhead radio , acre , etcetera although one of the factions are based on nato , it is all american equipment and characters voice acting is american for example editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications animations in general could do with a bit of a rework overall , i would rate the game about 8 10 simply based on my hours within arma iii i played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since it was great to be a part of that development process and i am glad i bought the game early really excellent game !",1.0

"if you are considering buying arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know about the multiplayer there are several modes of multiplayer there 's life , which is like an role playing type scenario there 's wasteland , which is like dayz but without zombies there 's also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes multiplayer can be rewarding , but the arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game there are some casual players , but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists if you like to have fun , i suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution they 're not all bad , but i have run into some that have units \( arma 's term for clans \) that do uniform inspections , boring training and , in one case , would not admit women to their unit because it was n't realistic just remember , if you 're not having fun then it is n't worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag other then that , the multiplayer can get quite laggy , but you can usually find another server to play on if that 's the case and bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer the game itself is a bit buggy it can break your immersion at times , but when it really counts \( in firefights \) it rarely glitches out on me this is a cpu intensive game if you have a so so processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner overall , i enjoy it a bunch there 's a lot to learn and i'm quite happy with the game",1.0

"the arma series has always been more of a simulator than a video game as such , it is not easy to get into there are tons of keybinds , the movement systems feels wonky due to being so tied to the animation system , and confrontations seem more a test of patience rather than reflex , engagements usually at 100 meters or more it also doesnt help that the ai can be incredibly incredibly stupid despite this , the series has garnered a strong following that has created a community of serious players that is hard to find anywhere else now , comes arma 3 arma 3 is not a fundamentally different game , but the developers have learned from the past , and they have given this iteration a sense of polish that makes it refreshing to this jaded arma fan , and very enticing to those curious about the series , but otherwise intimidated by arma 2 and 1 first off , arma 3 looks stunning the island is modeled after a real mediterranean island , and it shows there is a strong sense of authenticity as you walk , run , fly , and fight through the landscape it is worth plopping down a unit in the editor and just walking around , absorbing the sights the vastly improved lighting engine really adds to the entire experience lighthouses illuminate the world convincingly , and fires cast an impressive glow what makes the game feel so much better is the improved controls no longer do you move like a drunken mudcrab as one of my friends so succinctly said indeed the past games always made movement a struggle , with its reverse mouse acceleration , clumsy walking and running , and strange deadzone free aim mechanic \( which a lot of arma fans swear by , but i personally detest \) now with arma3 , the mouse is no longer hampered by that pesky reverse acceleration , movement is more fluid \( with some nice little touches such as tactical pace \) , and it introduces a fantastic modifier system that lets you pop up and down , left and right , for each stance its a simple addition , but adds so much to the combat , especially in a world where no cover is a perfect chest high wall the game also comes with a powerful editor while it is extremely daunting , even the most passing user can make some interesting scenarios , and for those who really want to learn , there are tools that will let you decompile other peoples missions to see how they do things its very much worth exploring , especially if you enjoy thinking of tactical what if situations what is most impressive is that my experiences with arma 3 so far have only been in alpha despite this , it runs and plays great , and things can only get better from here already , with the second update , performance and stability has increased tremendously as an alpha , i am already recommending this game highly honestly , if you are tired of the constant closed quarter combat corridor shooters like call of duty , and if battlefield 3 just doesnt seem real enough for you , check out arma 3 it just might scratch that itch of yours",1.0

"as you can see from this review , i have almost 500 hours in the game , so if you 're looking for someone who knows it , trust me arma 3 is a military simulator , which means that you are n't getting the constant grinding , free for all match ups you find in fps games like call of duty or battlefield it also does n't get much more realistic than this but in terms of the actual game , there are a plethora of things to do there are altis life rpg servers , which allow you to play the way you want , within certain constraints of course there are wasteland servers as well , which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in also , if you get a group of people , you can run some pretty awesome missions , not to mention have a blast with the zeus mode , which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically yes , there are bugs driving full force with a truck into a tank probably would n't cause it to blow up , for example rocks , walls , and even chicken wire fences can disable plenty of vehicles , and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow but the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on , such as dropping a truck from a helicopter , only to have it disappear the next instant , or fling back up and blow you out of the sky regardless of these , the actual content of arma 3 is massive , and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense the 59 99 price tag on this game should n't stop you from buying it , because it is worth every penny if you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time , you can find a ton of videos on youtube that may help you in your decision to buy it lastly , i mentioned before that this is not a call of duty or battlefield game they are all there own , and you may think that this game is too slow paced if you are looking for that run and gun format of a game but whileplaying this game , you find yourself in many different situations whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact , laser designating a target for air support to pulverize , or peaking around and pieing corners in a cqb scenario , you will find thousands of these unique situations , which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of fps 's and milsim 's alike",1.0

"this game has a ton of potential i'm a fan of the of the arma series , and bohemia interactive as a compnany i bought arma 3 back when it was in early access as an alpha back then , bohemia was releasing regular updates that included in game content i 've become very skeptical of steam early acess titles , but i trusted bohemia interactive as a company i have bought from before and have been happy with my purchases and received many hours of enjoyment from their previous titles \( arma 2 and carrier command to name a few \) arma 3 eventually hit beta , and later final release after the finalized product was increased in price the in game content soon stopped flowing then the karts dlc was released i thought oh this is just some fun thing the devs made some weekend i passed on it as it had a kind of high price tag for just a mini game calibre addon now the helicopter dlc came out it costs around 16 bucks with these helicopters came new game mechanics you can now tow vehicles via one of the dlc helicopters keep in mind , arma is a game that has an active community of modders , scripters , programmers , mappers and artists creating new content every week that 's not to say arma 2 did n't have its share of dlc however , for comparable prices you got a new singleplayer campaign , a few scenarios , and an array of vehicles opposed to just two this is the direction i do n't like to see arma go when i bought the pmc dlc for arma2 , it felt worth it i got more hours of gameplay by myself and singleplayer and many more options for transport and weaponry in multiplayer the arma3 dlc seems unfair the two combined are offered for a reduced price , with both dlcs \( around 25 dollars \) you get three vehicles , \( a kart and two helicopters \) , a few outfits , and a starter pistol on top of that , this game requires pretty fancy hardware to run above a steady 30 frames i 've found that this a very processor intensive game i recently went from an i3 processor to and i7 and now make 40 frames pretty steadily on very high or ultra however , when flying or otherwise moving fast , i still experience some heavy frame drops these do n't make the game unplayable by any means , but they do happen somewhat frequently \( usually when flying over large villages with lots of models , namely kavala \) for cas pilots , you 're almost always flying very low to the ground , and very fast the added frame drops increase the challenge of flying cas in urban areas now for people who are using lower end processors , you 'll find looking at a village , even not directly \( through terrain or a building \) will drop your frames by atleast five for people controlling zeus you 'll find that lag increases very quickly for your players the more things you put onto the battlefield it becomes apparant a lot sooner than you 'd expect for a game on the scale of arma 3 speaking of scale , a word often used when describing the main map , altis altis has a huge perfomance difference comparatively to other maps now , obviously , the bigger something is , the more intensive it is to render i never noticed differences in performances from chernarus to takistan , to namalsk , to zargabad , to utes on arma 2 granted , altis is a lot more urban than takistan for instance , and to be honest , i 'd rather play takistan if i can go anywhere on it i 've been on insurgency servers where going to kavala is against the rules because spawning ai in there increases lag to a huge degree being a finished game , arma 3 feels a bit empty on the side of vehicles and weapons there are tons of outfits , but i'm pretty sure there 's less than 20 guns \( not counting variants \) for a game as large as arma , you 'd think there would be a large array of weapons , similar to arma2 aside from that , being injured and out of breath really kills your aim , it does n't really feel right to me but i can live with it also , using scroll wheel as an action menu is still awkward as hell , but you get used to it again i can live with it that 's my gripe with arma 3 right now here 's what i like otherwise , arma 3 has great potential the zeus gamemode is innovation i 've been looking for in gaming for a long time it allows someone to take the role of a dungeon master and create the story of the mission as it proceeds with that it is tricky to be find a good zeus once you can make a challenging , but not impossible mission for your friends , it is a blast for everyone it 's even fun to mess around by yourself as zeus you can create your own missions , and since the ai is good it 's still challenging i love zeus and hope to see similar concepts in other games in the future flying is very tight flying is as near perfect as it gets for me i am very happy with the flying system in this game , i have not tried the advanced flying mode yet , but i imagine bohemia put the same care and attention into it as the now standard , default mode the land vehicles turning radiuses seem huge , but they are military vehicles the singleplayer story is a lot more intuitive and better paced than arma 2 i have not beat it yet , but there have been many moments i have enjoyed it is set up in a three part act , much like a movie , the middle being climax dilema the first act is rather short other than that , so far the campaign is much more engaging than arma2 the community for arma , if you 're not aware is terrific i love being able browse for addons other users created this allows units to personalize their gear and vehicles to better suit their playstyle \( navy , marines , airforce , etc \) there are tons of mods that make the game so much more involving and immersive if you get this game , i 'd say it 's a must to download a few mods i know i said the scale is too big above , but if there 's some things arma does right , one of them is scale when your on altis , or chernarus if you want something that runs better , you feel like you 're in huge area , and there could be fighting ten kilometers from where you 're fighting because of this , everything takes time getting a tank to a battlefield to tip the balance of the fight is a hard choice to make , because that fight could be lost by the time the tank gets there gunplay and movement are silky smooth , however , balistics seems a bit off some enemies seem to just absorb bullets sometimes bohemia included modified stances so you do n't have to download a mod the modified movements are very useful some things i do n't like that are n't bohemia 's fault servers feel pretty empty at the time i'm gaming , and takes a while to find a good operation you can no longer host a forward private server for your friends , due to the gamespy closing , steam took over , i do n't know if they 'll bring it back , but that was definitely part of the reason i got into arma it was very easy to pick up and do a mission with a couple of buds too many altis life servers all in all , i think arma 3 's path will change the community got pretty upset over the helicopter dlc , and with good reasons i like this game i still play it today is it worth fifty or sixty dollars \? probably not right now however , this game is n't by any means bad , and if you enjoy a more simulator feel when playing a first person shooter , i would say that this would be a pretty good game to get bohemia , i hope you gain my trust back \( sorry for any typos , wrote this late at night \)",1.0

"i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer , not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games , similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10 20 minutes in a single location \( sometimes longer , i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour \) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great , the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible \( unless doing paintballing or airgunning \) , and if you do buy the game i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game",1.0

"the latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general arma 3 features two new maps called stratis \( which can be compared to utes of arma 2 \) and altis , which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in east to west length the arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization , which is still evident in the latest insatllment , yet the optimization has been far improved in this version of bohemia interactive 's spotlight franchise the graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on ultra settings \( that is , if you can run it \) this game is still prone to glitches , bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning some of the bugs are eveident in player movent , which has been vastly improved upon the last installment , allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting the movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than arma 2 some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed the vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics \( however the physics are not on the par of games like forza 5 \) with realistic vehicle speeds the vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times the weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability , adding a more in depth \( no pun intended \) maritime experience this allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well some of the things i want to see in arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy \( for example , if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car \) another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you character 's weapons allowing for military simmulation dirve bys my final verdict of arma 3 is a very solid 8 5 out of 10 arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability , yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back bohemia interactive 's flagship series back once more if these glitches were to be fixed arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the call of duty franchise or battlefield franchise as well buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience , you can have a blast on this game",1.0

"this game is great this game has so much content , and bi are bringing more ! if you have n't played arma 2 , you will be blown away at the map sizes , of altis and stratis heaps of weapons and vehicles , and plenty of things to do there is also a big modding community , and with arma 3 being very easy to mod , it is a game expanding quite fast there are heaps of servers that bring you different game types also it has full steam workshop support ! this game is great to play with friends do n't expect a call of duty worth the money , every dollar",1.0

"fantastic game the single player content , showcases and training are good the real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though admittedly , it can be a bit confusing at first if you 're a new player , as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server there does n't tend to be a whole lot of vanilla servers out there however , the mods are fantastic and worth the effort , especially if you play them with a group of people my favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the insurgency mod \( military vs terrorists \) there 's a mod called task force radio , which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use each faction has their own encrypted radio , various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio \( long range and short range \) as the military , we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village a squad was unfortunately kia , and for the next two hours , the military was getting picked off constantly i even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo , let my team know that where i was and i had good sights on the village , and not 2 minutes later i got sniped even though i was hardly exposed and never took a shot later , it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won 10 10",1.0

"one of the best my current favorite game the amount of mods online modes available is ridiculous if you 're into the realism being strategic tactical then this game is definitely for you it 's not your average run gun fps like cod bf , so be warned it takes a while to get the hang of the game mechanics learn how to use everything properly because it is a simulator",1.0

"carrying on from the genre defining milsim that was arma 2 , arma 3 is a rock solid sequel that lives up to the expectations in place for the arma series , even managing to go a bit beyond in certain aspects as a great fan of arma 2 , i love arma 3 and the improvements bi have managed to implement into the game as well as showing off near future battlefield tech in the game to help accurately represent the game 's time period , bi have also managed to develop great maps , interesting gamemodes \( wasteland \) for online play , and still manage to maintain and improve upon the fun level of realism that made arma 2 so popular with milsim players the modding scene is also very active , with mods such as ace and acre out there for added realism and more 'serious' milsim players which allows the game to be expanded upon a lot be warned however , the game is n't shy on performance and requires a decent rig to run properly even on mid range settings my only major whine about the game itself is the developer 's choice to release the campaign in a series of 'episodes' , drip feeding us content and missions but as each episode is released , this negative becomes less and less of a factor i'm giving arma 3 a 9 10 , and deffinitely recommend this game",1.0

"ah , arma 3 many people might not enjoy this game as this game unlike most fast fps 's or tactical shooters , arma lets you play on a 270km squared terrain you may approach an objective how you want it , if the mission scenario allows it , when you want it \( hvt convoy passing through , gotta be on time \) and with what you want it overall the optimization is okay as the game recieves constant updates with the biggest one is a free zeus gamemode dlc being released on dev branch fixes pour through constantly as well as new features or updates , arma 3 like all the previous arma games provides a simple to use editor which can be used to create a simple firefight , or an all out war with dynamic units and performance scripts the graphics are really good which helps the immersion , thes a weather setting so you can be having a nice vacation in greece or be infiltrating an enemy base in the stormy seas of altis , \( altis is the 270km squared island , stratis is smaller , yet enjoyable \) under the cover of fog , as you disembark you grab your gear from the boat , armed with smg 's with flashlights in the night and with the help of moonlight you make your way through the forest , you get to a road a csat convoy passes by , not noticing you you carry on this can be the begining of a mission very easily this is what makes arma unique , you can script a whole event to make it a michael bay movie or let the players make a critical decision of wether retreating or holding ground arma ofcourse features realistic bullet drop , recoil and stance adjustments , remember those old fashioned stand , crouch , prone type stances \? well no more ! you can now adjust yourself into a variety of stances such as high crouch , low crouch , high stand and many others you can peek round walls or shove a part of your body out and spray at the enemy this gives you a whole lot more freedom than many other games , not to mention 90 buildings are enterable , yet without furniture just at the moment let 's speak a bit about ai , they are currently undergoing changes and they can be very accurate , not accurate , smart or just dumb as each unit has a skill bar and the games has difficulty levels such as recruit , regular or veteran higher which can all be adjusted to multiple points such as hud , waypoints , friendly skill , enemy skill and much more they can still provide a very authentic experience now , the game is called a finished game , but not all agree features pour in and so do fixes the amount of content compared to previous titles is smaller , but not everything is finished csat nato jets are coming in a few weeks as an example the great thing is that the community is devoted , helping and of all active mods are rolling out hot from the oven every day , hell some people are making a dinosaur mod ! and from what i know , official arma 3 mod tools are not even released if it 's re skins or dinosaurs , or perhaps arma 2 content , it is all there and more baking each day the developers are active and listen to the community and that helps them make a quality game , even better yet i do understand alot of people dont like it if they have come from older series such as arma 2 for lack of content or glitches , then they ofcourse dont remember what was arma 2 's launch like \) the game is gradually getting better , and yes i agree arma 2 has more content and is more modern combined with the operation arrowhead expansion , but arma 3 is a great game too or great modules lacking such as the medic module \( a revive like module , for wounded people \) or great mods such as advanced combat environment or invasion 1944 , most mods are coming over to arma 3 , yet there is a waiting barrier of course but if you are still confused if you want to buy the game arma 3 cars have working mirrors i would rate the game at the current state 7 5 10",1.0

"the main reason why i bought arma3 was for the wasteland mod i played arma 2 pretty heavily and i can say for sure that arma3 wasteland is far superior than dayz in every respect except for survival foraging i played quite a bit of arma2 dayz and i feel that the mod is extremely overrated compared to the other mp experiences arma has to offer this review may be more helpful to those who are thinking about the decision to move to arma3 from arma2 arma 3 improves upon arma 2 in many ways first it reduces the amount of clutter on the keyboard now there is n't \( what feels like \) fifty keys dedicated to command radio and now there is more of a streamlined feel to the game that being said , it 's extremely necessary to play with voice , as calling out targets orders is something that is required in this game , unless you are a lone wolf or you are in a rather large group where the need for such things is lessened also , a major update in graphics , which i must say are stunning compared to a2 this does n't make arma , but it helps you stay immersed needless to say , arma will always be unoptimized , so please , learn simple optimization tricks before giving up after seeing you have 30 frames it 's worth it the amount of customizations in this game is extremely helpful useful be warned though , it may take some time before you get the hang of it as arma , being buggy , has a tendency to make things hard plus there 's the fact that sometimes a player can get their hands on a fantastic sniper rifle , minus the scope \( i'm pointing at you wasteland \) so be warned of these situations before you find yourself in one that is n't to your liking after all of this i would suggest that people with lower end computers do n't buy this game or be prepared to run it on low settings but the low settings are nothing to be mad about , as they are still pretty damn good , and graphics are not something that you come to arma for in the first place now for those who have n't experienced the military sim feels \( you know what i'm talking about \) arma delivers when played right , it delivers a deep comradery that cannot be gotten from most other games on the market when you achieve something with your friends , who you sometimes have to place 100 trust in , it can be awe inspiring and can lead to many ecstatic shouts over the radio for doing something seemingly insignificant if seen through eyes of a standard fps player now about gameplay arma requires an extreme amount of patience normally you have one or two rounds of fire to get things right or you will be sent to the death screen bullets hurt really bad normally getting hit with one is life threatening if it 's normal caliber , but any more than that and you could be facing a bit of a journey back this normally means 10 20 minutes to regroup and find another battle worth fighting but do n't worry , many of my fondest memories of arma are from moments that are just random and unexpected , and they do n't even require the slightest trace of enemy presence \( http i imgur com ggaptfx jpg \) from arma2 tl dr arma 3 is a much improved upon arma 2 , nothing extremely new here but there 's still quite a bit more which makes it worth getting if your computer can handle the game and you can handle the buggyness playstyle of arma it is one of my favorite games and is the leader of its genre , and rightfully so for those wondering approximately 300 hours of game time logged on arma2",1.0

"this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming , this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things having done both military service and picked up milsim airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality there are experiences you will have in arma 3 that can not be had in cod or bf , experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release one that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower , i was squad leader of 8 or so ai s as we approached the comms tower and i told my men to go stealth , no firing unless fired upon we moved slowly taking advantage of terrain , keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and i spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower there i positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as i had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower i considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position but a firefight is always a risk , and these ai had been around for a few missions and i had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly i might get hit and killed as i considered how i would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern , i realised the tower is unguarded and i had an opportunity to do something i had not considered i got up and ran as fast as i could towards the tower , all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head i kept scanning as i ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols after what seemed like far too long i reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure , if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention i turned around and made my way back , as i closed on my men i started ordering them to fall back , hope growing that i might get out of this alive falling back to about 400 meters i finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell , from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to command i had done it i had pulled off the perfect mission , not a shot fired and all under my command back alive that is what this game is about",1.0
"oh man where to even begin with this one it would be an extreme disservice to simply call arma 3 a shooter , as it is so , so much more than that arma 3 is a military simulator this is a distinction that its developers hold sacred and are proud of , and one to which i can attest is completely accurate and deserved but its even more than that arma 3 is a gaming platform , upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come at its core though , arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim the graphics are stunning , the gameplay is excellent , the mechanics are solid , and bohemia interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together new comers to the arma series \( as i was \) may initially be overwhelmed by the games complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical fps shooter enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief , brutal , and more times than not will conclude with your demise there is no handholding here no mini maps , no enemy ui icons indicators , no hit markers , no health bars if you get shot a couple of times , you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched while this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players , it provides a unique and distinctive play style situational awareness , cover , teamwork , suppressive fire , and generally moving purposefully and as if your depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles , armor , helicopters , and planes , each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master , and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience out of the box , arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts , each containing 12 15 missions the campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over arma 3s two huge islands of stratis and altis you play the part of a nato soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement the campaign is rewarding , and challenging \( i have yet to complete it as im stuck on one mission that i simply cant seem to complete \) however the single player campaign is far from the end of this title the mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions , all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs i would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods whole lotta altis and dynamic universal war system which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves oh and the multiplayer , oh god the multiplayer wasteland , king of the hill , invade and annex , battle royale , breaking point , so many co op opportunities , the amazing looking upcoming epoch \( currently in closed alpha \) im sure there are so many others that i havent even discovered yet each of these represent completely user generated and totally disparate ways to play multiplayer within the arma 3 platform by purchasing arma 3 , you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game in wrapping up this lengthy review , arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development it is the only game in recent memory that i can say with confidence that i never get bored with playing bohemia interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come , and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless purchase this game purchase it now thank me later \( if you do not find my review helpful , please leave a comment as to why i welcome the constructive feedback \)",1.0

"i have owned this game for a number of weeks now and i have been completely hooked great game for the more serious war gamer , not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from call of duty series which i consider more for the younger gamers anyway arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games , similar to battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using you will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10 20 minutes in a single location \( sometimes longer , i personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour \) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward you will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance you can not respawn as quickly as you can in cod if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic the graphics are great , the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to i recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible \( unless doing paintballing or airgunning \) , and if you do buy the game i recommend completing the whole vr tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game",1.0

"we were a group of 3 soldiers stranded in a city in the middle of nowhere , with only sidearms to protect ourselves 9mm 's in our hands which compared to the firepower of our enemy , it would make them have good laughs our top priority was scavanging for supplies and guns we found an old suv parked in the middle of a town hall , with apparent damaged transmission and busted wheel i procede to repair the suv , while our squad 's sniper and combat medic scout for any enemy infantry or vehicles i was a professional engineer with 10 years of duty repairing stuff no one cares about until they are broken after the repairing took place with no problems , we look to the trunk of the suv boy , it was like looking at the lord two assault rifles accompanied by their respective ammo now we were loaded , and looking at our next mission we saw a convoy 2 clicks away from our position we took this as a chance to gear up and scavenge food and water while fighting the enemy at the same time while en route to our ambush location we found a military truck with a big anti tank weapon sitting of top of it it was the perfect setting , except the engine did n't work we had to toe it to our suv even with all my experience i could n't put the engine up and running , but the gun worked we set up at the ambush point waiting for the enemy but while waiting we saw a big white vehicle in the mountain north coming toward us , which was being towed is that a god damn boat sailing on land on the back on a truck ! \? said our sniper it had miniguns attached to it , and the instance we saw them , we proceded to open fire with our anti tank weapon it was a tough fight they shot back as soon as they heard our shots and fought the best way they could but our weaponry was too strong for them the truck catched fire and exploded after a couple rounds into it , killing all the enemies in the vicinity it looked like a scene from a michael bay film after that , we ambushed the convoy , stole a couple of anti tank rpg 's and sold them into the black market to buy a tank 10 10 it was good",1.0

"this game is very well done it is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game this is also somewhat a downside though it makes missions being done by yourself without any ai or player assistance very difficult but if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions , you will enjoy this game the multiplayer is awesome before i found this game , i had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point the workshop feature makes the game even better , being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have this is overall a pretty cool game",1.0
"arma 3 is an excellent game in the way that gun play is realistic in the sence that if you 're the first to shoot you usually get the kill , vehicles are mega fun , the general flow of the game is a lot more to my liking compared to say call of duty instead of run and gun , it is probably best if you plan out what you are going to do probably the best part about arma 3 is the mods and other game modes they have , 2 random examples are battle royale and altis life \( if you do n't know what they are you should probably look them up , they 're fun \) \) but this game has down sides too such as to enjoy altis life you really have to play it with a friend \( s \) otherwise it 's kind of hard to get into battle royale is definitely an option for lone wolves such as myself but there 's a downside to that too , you always seem to get a clan of 5 or 6 in every match , i honestly do n't understand why , seeing as it 's a free for all they do n't care though and they group up anyway to be completely honest it 's a game some people hate and some people love i myself love it but it really depends on if you like ultra realism \( like this game \) or the kind of realism in bf4 the things i have mentioned are my personal opinion and i really don't mean to change the view of the game for anyone",1.0

"arma 3 is definately improved on arma 2 , and what it lacked at launch is now in the game full campaign when we start to get more maps , i think arma 3 will be a very good purchase right now , it is quite fun if you are in for a full military simulation , however if you are looking for the aftermarket mods like dayz \( or any big mods , i do n't think dayz will be in arma 3 for obvious reasons \) then you should wait a bit arma 3 was definately worth the full price , and it was one of the only games in recent times to really wow me with such massive scale and for those new to the series , arma 3 should n't be too intimidating as it has many tutorials , but in game and outside it once again , arma has a very good level editor , which you can access from the game and begin making scenarios straight away , or use external scripts for more advanced ones , if you know how to",1.0

"this is definitely one of the hardest games i have played , i mean , i tried the first mission 30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy i had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle , but the next was just as hard i do n't think dark souls is this hard , and it gets worse as you progress one annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage german porn flick , i guess nato must have lowered the standards in 2035 he 'll start panting after 30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run , even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but do n't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game , you can have much more fun with the editor it takes some time to figure it out , but you can make really good missions with it the graphics is good , but you need a very powerful pc to play it with high settings the fps is showing when you do the changes so you do n't have to exit the menu to test it a joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters the game have a good variety of weapons , equipment and vehicles the ballistics add a touch of realism",1.0

fantastic game with a mind blowing amount of customization and a great modding community the game is a military sim and is quite true to the details though i will stress this game is very complex when it comes to the controls and customization as of now there is no easy way to create a loadout without coding in some nasty box of text there is plans to fix this but just be warned this game does require decent understanding of pc gaming due to mass amount of controls and options there is big leaning curve but i would high recommend this game,1.0

"arma 3 enhances on the arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience with arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you could n't get in cover because of the really bad control scheme , however with arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system the vehicles of arma 3 are a lot better than arma 2 , it works i ca n't wait until mods like ace are released on arma 3 expanding on the experience even more it 's well worth the price although the content is slightly lacking , the game expands on arma 2 loads and i'm sure an expansion pack like operation arrowhead will appear for arma 3 aswell buy it , well worth it",1.0

amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel \( aka simulator \) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor the controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do i would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring that is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there,1.0

"this game is amazing straight up no ifs ands or buts about it it does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles , for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to arma2 but this will likely change over the course of the game 's life as bi is releasing new content in sections like the campaign then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over \) if you 're at all into milsim or hardcore fps games you 're probably going to love this the game 's biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want to in it you want to drive into the target area with a sub , swim to shore and rise out of the water like a navy s e a l \? you can do that want to fly in in an ah 6 loaded for bear \? you can do that , want to fly a jet \? drive a tank \? skydive \? attack at night \? use a mortar \? be a sniper \? fly an attack heli \? or just go in as a footsoldier \? arma 3 's got you covered it 's as it is advertised the ultimate military sandbox probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity",1.0
best game in the world,1.0
"with the right mods and people , this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat at least for the ground warfare arma 's best feature is the dedicated modding community , you can find a mod for just about anything for arma the game simulates fatigue , breathing and pain effect , as well as weapon weight , meaning that there wo n't be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range there is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics i love pretty much everything about arma except these two things , of course , nothing is perfect the game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively , even with my nvidia 770 graphics card , larger battles decrease frames quite a bit and finally , arma 's controls can be rather clunky at times , the stance lean controls specificly it can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster overall 9 5 10 definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy teamwork and tactical combat",1.0
"an amazing game ! 6 5 10 as i started from the alpha of arma 3 , i noticed as the game progressed i lost my ability to not only run the game once it hit beta but also blue screened three times i 've had multiple problems and even mangaged to fix the issue after hours and hours of searching for the answer to the issues now as beta was a complete horror and full release was right around the corner i decided like many others to quit playing and go back to some good old arma 2 a c e and waited till the games full release as i was pumped for the full release i noticed that nothing had changed from the beta same maps , same vehicles , same sounds , same weapons , and same factions the lack of things for the sea was a huge disappointment because the arma 3 engine actually has a working water system and it was completely wasted the lack of air vehicles especially no big cargo plane makes traveling on altis boring and hard to move from place to place although it says its a arma game i dont feel as if it compares to its counter parts yes , a graphical update has been put up for the game itself but after playing arma 2 i dont feel the immersion of arma gold edition and arma 2 in arma 3 but , it does have alot of neat things like futuristic vehicles , amazing hud system , stance system , amazing animations , ability for both customization over weaponary uniform and a bunch of downloadable mods maps that can keep you playing for hours just like arma 2 i'm just disappointed that they did n't take their time on this game why could n't they have made this game better by looking at what players loved in the previous games like the ace mod or even some of the other cool things like i44 , vte , and etc although all the bad things i have said its still a game in development and could possibly have a big turn around i just hope this game becomes better in the future so i can start enjoying it again",1.0

"arma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than it 's predecessor yes , like those it follows arma 3 has it 's bugs , but these are in no way irritating at most , they are hilarious because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon , methodically removing enemy ai from their short lived lives , when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades hoovering in a tank or being insta killed by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble , breaks the cycle ! it 's a game you have to try out you can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go but do n't be a lone wolf and complain it was boring arma is about team work and not your call of duty or battlefield tdm capture the flag balls but actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive ! the a i on this game is effective they will suppress , they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places it 's very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly a good squad will have a much higher survival rate ! so get yourself in a game , be a local on the server and join in with regulars to have the best experience there is a lot to learn , but arma 3 's new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful heaps of content the workshop has lots more additions goto armaholic for the best and widest range of addons my only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install so it maybe best to use a loader i'm a big fan of the arma series and this one has raised the bar again ! get your 's off cod bf and play a real game ! ! ! 11 10",1.0

"todays review arma3 short scorebased review \( longer review below \) overall 73 90 singleplayer 7 10 the game is hard you would do well to save as often as possible multiplayer 8 10 its great for multiplayer , sadly the in game browser still lacks refresh button and fails to ever find the server you want to find on a properly forwarded server still stakes 30m 1hour of tinkering for your friends to find it vehicles 7 10 vehicles are cool , plentiful , feel well balanced and responsive weapons 9 10 lots of weapons , with now as added bonus you can customize them multiplayer missions 3 10 couple of premade missions , most of them proof of concepts no real fun to be had untill you download some from workshop or armaholic i recommend playing my zeus based map which is like playing with a dungeon master who can spawn everything and anything if not that use their awesome easy to use editor and make one yourself ! editor 6 10 it works , but doing advanced stuff requires lots of google usage lots of wiki diving and being best friends with the bohemia interactive website also does n't generate a full mission as it does not include some sort of default description ext in the mission file dlc 33 40 1 zeus 10 10 play as a dungeon master , make a scenario on the go its free 2 karting 8 10 make races , drive in karts and wear the arma 3 karting outfit , adds racing elements for race lovers 3 marksman 9 10 adds weapons , loadouts , weaponmods , some items , facepaint , garrage its good , trust me 4 helicopter 6 10 adds two helicopters , and helicopter pods adds sling loading \( aka pick stuff up and drop it elsewhere \) long review below if you have played arma 2 and loved it you will love arma 3 its the same game with better graphics , a lot of additions and great changes anyone can just say that though so lets get into some specific as to why arma 3 is a great game for fans of the series and for new players lets start with some points for new players arma 3 is a realistic military combat simulator or that is at least what i'm going to call it every iteration seems to contain 2 big landmasses one is generally a lot bigger in this case the big landmass you 'll probably find yourself always playing on is altis its big , varied from mountainous to large flats and has a small dessert the game comes with many vehicles for both ground , air and water transportation as well as combat we have well known vehicles and newer imaginary versions based on existing vehicles there are also uav 's that can be controlled by a single or multiple players as for the gameplay you play as the traditional teams bluefor , opfor , independant or civilian movement system is great , feels very fluid and responsive vehicles can be damaged as a whole or you can shoot out their tires engine realistic physics allow for some holy moments no seriously if you have no idea how physics apply to fast moving vehicles this game will teach you by making your car roll over at high speed bends , or lets not forget the time i drove a truck on top of a plane hangar because i hit a quadbike , then bounced up onto a sand barrier , which launched me in the correct angle and with my speed i made it up there then i asked an admin for salvation because falling off was certain death ! player damage can range from just a fleshwound to holy my leg is gone medic ! ! ! ! ! if you get shot in a leg you wo n't be able to run etc 10 for pain uhhhh ahhhh uuuuuuuuhhhh arma 3 is mainly a big sandbox missions can let you roam all of it or just a small ao still you know at all times that everything you see is somewhere you can go almost all buildings can be entered and interestingly with enough explosives , almost all of them can be destroyed into nothing but ruble too for veteran players its arma 2 with better graphics and some improvements the old maps can still be played and included with mods warning button bindings make sense now g grenade i inventory car mirrors now actually work lots of overhauls to the core game systems helicopters from the dlc pack now can lift , cars , vehicles , boxes , in game server browser is still arma 3 has a launcher which allows you to play without battleeye if you do n't want your computer data compromised no seriously before accepting read the tos for using battleeye i think most people would disagree if they actualy read it , you can still play without agreeing to it arma 3 zeus maps , aka make your own fun on the go , its a sandbox dungeon master , its fun , try it arma 3 has arma 3 dayz epoch , its great , try it if you love zombie survival racing is now possible karting and other vehicles too ai are improved , no longer and are deadly at close and long range expect to be fighting them like trained professionals because they will wreck you for the rest its basicly the same as arma 2 i guess simply , if you liked arma 2 then buy this one you 'll love it its worth it thank you for your time",1.0
"arma 3 takes me back to the days of deltaforce \( long time ago \) , it being a thoroughly enjoyable tactical military shooter , albeit with its own special glitches and graphics fails the interface may seem somewhat clunky at first but you soon overcome that , and although the game has many controls they quickly become familiar and are relatively intuitive the scales and graphics on arma are pretty impressive , although as in many games , the graphics are less impressive up close , less the textures and more the number and complexity of objects , however , with a game of this size if each house was packed with objects , you can bet the frames are going to take a massive hit , what bohemia have done is find a reasonable balance with this generally the environment looks great , there are some questionable physics interactions which can make for some strange happenings , although that is part of the charm with arma if you want a military sim , that generally plays pretty well with a decent amount of guns and vehicles to mess about in then this is well worth it whilst not quite as slick as some games built on newer game engines , arma does hold up pretty well",1.0

"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing everything fromt he graphics , to physics to sound effects are really good oh and if you do n't want to use the vanilla stuff , again there 's mods , even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one there 's also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues , which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter one player acts like the dm and the others play in his her world allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up for information on how to mod your game , check out this youtube video https www youtube com watch \? v kk6rswmivyi",1.0
"general arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military action , objectives and tactics once you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls and commands , but you 'll get the hang off it eventually we 'll start off with the campaign you play as corpral kerry in the nato forces altis and stratis the two main islands are being invaded by csat \( bad guys \) even though there is nothing you can do about it , the nato forces are trying to force them back , and near the end of the campaign you have two choices , try and find out where james \( friend \) is or play a part in the final stand against csat , depending on the choice you choose you could win or lose the map editor is a good addition , it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i do the scenery on the islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better the realistic weather is by far the best weather you 'll see in a long time , like if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticaly it is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way also look out for animals like goats , deer and rabbits on land , in the sea there are fish , turtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving there is a dedicated community on steam workshop , they create player made missions , weapons , vehicles and mods there are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game aircraft the aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft land vehicles the land vehicles also look well designed the selection of tanks in the game are plentiful the civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and the infintry transport look and drive just like they should water transport there are n't as much boats as there are land vehicles but there does n't need to be there are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats there are also submarines as well pros 1 great simulation 2 big open world to explore 3 amazing scenery 4 well designed vehicles cons 1 hard to learn aircraft piloting over all score 8 10",1.0

"if you are considering buying this game , read this first let me say this i really enjoy this game its massive open world environment makes it an awesome combat simulator it comes with fun stock game modes , and has a good fan base but if you really want to have fun , i highly reccommend playing some mods , such as breaking point , battle royale , and altis life , to name a few pros large open world terrain challenging gameplay there is a thrill everytime you play it never gets old good mod support lots of vehicles air , land and water realistic engine almost endless possibilities cons poorly optimized even on my 1500 00 custom build , i still averge only about 40 fps , dipping to 15 fps sometimes this is a minor problem , seeing as my average of 40 fps is more than playable , however it is still an anoyance the game has its fair share of glitches for example , sometimes i 'll be driving behind one of my teammates when his truck snaps back and destroys mine , killing me in the process nothing happens on my teammate 's screen many of the glitches are purley aesthetic , for example , when you die , sometimes your neck stretches out to 5x its size a bit like bf3 while the sounds in the game are decent , they are not exactly fantastic to fix this , get jsrs sound mod are you thinking of getting this game just for altis life \? many people do thats fine , infact many of the biggest servers are altis life servers i play on gsn 's altis life server it has an excellent community and friendly admins overall , the game is very fun , and a massive improvement over arma 2 i would give it 8 10 thanks for reading update so , after spending over 200 hours on this game , i will say this playing this will change you if you are a cod player , battlfield player , etc , you will find yourself 'not challenged' by the gameplay anymore i 've gone back to cod once or twice , and it no longer provides me with the realistic thrill that it once did if you are in the market for realism , and a game that requires real strategy , get arma just remember , your play style must adapt you cannot rush you cannot spray \( well , you can , but you will likely die and get yelled at \)",1.0

"for players who have never played arma and go into this game with no expectations , it 's okay the game works for that but , for people with expectations for this game , \( for example , arma 2 fans \) it is completely unacceptable the game completely dwarfs all previous arma games in many aspects the graphics and engine are much better it has a great core , with great potential but that , sadly , is all it has the game itself has to have been rushed on the official release day , it was in the state of an alpha game , and still feels like a beta for most people the game had an actual alpha and beta on steam , but from the player 's point of view , not much changed between alpha and release day except for a few new assets and the main map being released it never should have left the alpha , and the problem is that bohemia does n't seem to have admitted to even themselves that their game came out unfinished from release day , they have been treating it like a final product , with only a few small polishes and fixes needed this is beyond the exact opposite of how it actually is on release day , it was laughably broken it had the most bugs i have ever seen in a game , and felt like a joke now , after 1 5 years , many obvious bugs have been ironed out i can say that the very surface game experience is acceptable the problem today is that while they fixed some of the basic gameplay issues , about 40 of the features feel unfinished , but that is coming from someone with 1000 hours of experience as i said , the surface experience is acceptable , but if you really start playing , you will notice inexcusable holes in the experience along with all of this , the game is set in 2035 , so none of the objects in the game are real , and at best partially resemble real things the nato and aaf factions are okay , but the csat faction , the only opfor faction available , looks terrible the csat people literally look like aliens , and i get depressed every time i see one of them what was bohemia thinking \? why would you put space aliens in a military simulator , especially arma \? atleast put terrorists , or north koreans , or normal russians , but space aliens \? this is very controversial , especially for a military simulator , in particular arma currently , the helicopters dlc costs 15 the game shipped with only a few helicopters , so it was good to hear that they were addressing this it was sad to hear they were charging 15 for something that should have been included with the game , but i could live with that what really set me off is that for 15 you get only two helicopters yes , 2 helicopters that you should already have for 15 dollars with the arma 2 oa expansion , we literally got more assets than arma 3 will probably ever have for 20 dollars now we pay 15 dollars for 2 helicopters currently , from what i can see , arma 3 is doomed they are going to continue charging money for each baby step towards a finished game , and with that , only make a few baby steps , and then run off with the money the only dlc remaining will be a dlc called marksmen which adds 7 weapons , all of which i 've played with , and most of which look like laser guns , almost as bad as the csat faction bohemia also has a interesting dlc model which makes the dlc more like updates with certain assets you ca n't play with unless you buy the dlc this will mean marksmen comes with an upgraded weapon system and 3 vests all of which everyone gets , but ingame the core dlc items are unusable without paying there may also be an expansion way after the marksmen dlc comes out , but nothing has been confirmed about it tldr arma 3 is a dissapointment for real arma fans because holes in the general experience , not enough stuff and weird art style not appropriate for military simulators",0.0

"this game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots , but then bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it you can find screenshots jam packed with weapons , attachments , camos , characters , and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development that might have been an accpetable option , except bohemia did n't fully commit because of this , a lot of the game is just copy pasted nonsesne almost all vehicles use the same hmgs , gmgs , and auto cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle all static weapons such as the mortar , gpmg , and anti tank anti air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions there 's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game , all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety an example of this is the mx and katiba these each have their respective variants in the cqb , regular , grenadier , and dmr roles , but each one of them is the exact same they have the same ballistics , same damage , same recoil , same magazine capacity \( even though the mx has a much longer , thicker mag than the katiba , \) and hell , even the same round ! take a look back at arma ii , you 'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go , but in arma iii everything feels the exact same and in many cases it is the exact same they could n't add a different auto cannon for each faction , but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear ! another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future without actually adding any futuristic content any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that look futuristic the merkava replaces the m1a2 abrams tank in the least sensible move since jimmy carter running for a second term , the bradley is replaced by the namer , another israeli tank , and come to think of it , this entire game is a showcase for israel this does n't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it 's spread out amongst all factions , but it made a lot of sense in the original story when israel was annexed by csat and csat started using israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their soviet made equipment from yester year this is a great example why they should 've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game when you get down to the core of it all , all that matters is the gameplay unfortunately , that is horrendous , too the game feels like they watched rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in arma ii , combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying , even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill ! full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you do n't you 're going to be the one in a body bag seriously , they took a simulator game and turned it into call of duty the encumberance system is another horrible mess seriously , your character is not fit for military shape because he ca n't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break , and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction , because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to china and is shaking harder than michael j fox with a cold another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is seriously , even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and , at times , outright freeze framing all in all , i would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the arma series , because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience",0.0

"i tried to enjoy this game , but i could not i have several aspects i 'd like to point out to make clear why i do n't recommend buying this game 1 a totally unoptimized engine the graphics in this game are great , no doubt about that but the engine and the fps i am getting definetely are not my pc has up to date components which do meet the recommend requirements , except for my graphics card it is a gtx 760 , recommended one is a gtx 680 though i accept that i cant get the best amount of fps with this card in a a game like arma 3 but only 27 fps max in a multiplayer match with 10 people online and the graphics settings at low , view distance set to 1000 and with shadows deactivated \? this is not a fault of my 760 , it is because the engine of this game is totally unoptimized 2 an ai which is dumb as f i expect , that the ai in a game that is based so heavily on teamwork is atleast acceptable but this is not the case in arma 3 , no ! the ai of the comrades you will lead during several singleplayer missions is so bad , that i would need to look for a word to describe it they resist to follow your orders instantly , for example when you tell them to enter a car they will walk around like a headless chicken before finally remembering that there is a car they should enter and if you 're unlucky , they wo n't enter the car at all this is just one exmaple , but there are many cases where the ai would have to be improved maybe in arma 4 , which i certainly wo n't buy if they keep their attitude towards the game and the players like in arma 3 3 terrible mission design there are several missions which do just have terrible design for example a mission where you have to make your way through a destroyed town with tons of enemies , vehicles \( which i could n't use for some reason \) and barely any supplies but this is not the only case there are several other missions with a bad design , where you maybe have to walk for several minutes , or run to keep up with your mate and then encounter an enemy squad but you ca n't hit any of them because your level of fatigue is too high so that your hands shake and ca n't aim as you would need too sure , it might be realistic , but here it is just gamebreaking luckily there is a way to skip a mission hold down shift and on your numpad and then type endmission \( you can release shift and while typing \) and i am thankful for this option because i was stuck forever with this one particular mission , but let 's move on 4 \( small \) things that could have been better there are some small things aside from the big ones that coould have been better if the developers would have taken more time to improve the game for example the body armor in the singleplayer depending on what pieces of armor you 're wearing , you get an armor rating \( which you ca n't see anywhere \) , and the amount of shots you can tolerate before dying depends on that rating sometimes i would just die from one shot \( and no , it was n't the 408 ct or the 99x108mm \( 50 \) that hit me \) and wonder why i died although i was wearing armor \( note that i am talking of the singleplayer \) and the enemy did take like 4 shots to kill ! seems like my armor rating was not high enough but how should i know \? see , the problem is that you ca n't know , because nowhere is written how good that armor is it would 've been nice if they would have given every piece of armor a value , like 0 for no protection , 40 70 for decent protection and 100 for high protection they should have also provided checkpoints for campaign levels well , you can save manually , bu if you forgot to and die , well you will be kinda annoyed when you have to do the whole mission again and let me tell you that the missions are not short ones but there are also good things about the game the graphics are beautiful and if you have a high amount of fps i'm sure that the multiplayer provides alot of fun thee are also so many vehicles from tanks to submarines , artillery , jets , choppers , attack boats there is also an option to make time passing by faster press the key to the left of backspace to increase time 's speed , and the button left to this one to decrease time 's speed especially useful when you have to walk forever again and another aspect i like are the realistic ballistics of the guns depending on their ammunition type but cave dovah , you wrote that u do n't like it when u die from one shot seems like u have no idea and are not trustworthy ! no , wait i wrote that i did not like the system with the armor rating but the ballistics should stay like they are , because what would a military simulator be without realistic ballistics \? i think that everyone should decide on their own whether they buy this game or not i just tried to help you \( and hope i succeeded \) with this choice by writing about the negative aspects , since there are enough reviews already which cover the good ones enough i personally regret to have bought this game , mostly because of the fps i am getting although i am close to the recomended requirements , but hey , that 's just my opinion",0.0

"i can not in all honesty recommend this game to anyone , and here 's why its 32 bit in the most simplest terms this means the game can only use a maximum of 2gb of ram , there are other restrictions to this but this is the one that hurts performance the most multi threading this should have been a priority during development but instead it almost seems like bohemia forgot about this , it is poor , and extremely bottlenecked , resulting in low performance realism a lot of people go on and on about the realism in vanilla there is only a basic \( and i mean basic \) bullet drop system no realistic ballistics whatsoever without the use of mods , you could literally be in one of the biggest thunderstorms the game could throw at you with gales , rain and all the other lovely things and you will still be able to drop a target at close to a mile away with a precise headshot , simply by pointing up a bit there are quite literally dozens of examples of how this game is not realistic , here 's just a few vehicle behaviour is a joke , choppers have been updated in the choppers dlc to be more realistic but even then that means you have 2 completely different flight models for vanilla choppers vs vanilla jets , obviously they are different one is a chopper the other is a fixed wing jet but here 's what i mean , choppers now take into account wind speed , direction , variable gusts , as well as reaction forces , mostly to do with real world physics and all manner of other things whereas the jets simply do n't , they feel like they are on rails there is no real skill involded \( unless dogfighting \) in flying them ground vehicles are just as bad there was a more 'realistic' driving model in the original grand theft auto and that is the nicest thing i could say about it low res vs high res players this admittedly is a multiplayer pvp issue so wont affect pve or sp gameplay but ill try to explain it , in pvp \( if you play pvp \) you will notice your getting sniped even though your behind a bush or shot through a fence or something similar , this is because 'low res' players cant see these details because it is too far away and not yet 'drawn' for them , but they can see you , this is because the draw distance for a character is permanent and un changeable \( it does change but cant be changed by the player , without mods \) whereas the detail draw can be changed through changing settings this is in case you wish to improve performance , but this inherently means if you play pvp you have to play with everything turned down just to be on a level playing field not very realistic is it \? 3rd vs 1st person in pvp multiplayer , 3rd person players can see around corners , over walls etc , whereas 1st person players cant making 1st person in pvp pointless , nothing more to say player animation this is the thing that really bugs me to the point i have rage quit in the past , in what possible universe would a person have to stand still in a firefight just to change weapons \? there are other animations i detest but that one gets me the most note this can be fixed with mods ai behaviour the ai in this game is a joke , and not a funny one , they are like headless chickens running around with guns shooting at sounds , for example i was playing a game with friends the other night when our pilot was one shotted at over 300m \( altitude \) from an ai enemy with a bog standard katiba \( which is based on a khaybar \) with its skill setting turned down to 45 100 , not only was this ridiculous it is also unrealistic , i have fired assault weapons irl \( not a khaybar unfortunately \) but i can tell you now there is no way in the entirety of the road to hell could you possibly one shot a pilot in a chopper in the sky flying over 300m at over 80mph with any kind of assault weapon , only with a powerful rifle would you even have a chance and even then the shot must be spectacular and ideally head on to the chopper , what have i learned from this there is no ballistic shielding simulated in vanilla choppers either in its hull \( which would be around the cockpit and gunner positions \) or in the cockpit glass and if it is , it is in desperate need of an update i simply refuse to mention ai pilots because they are dead , i killed them all for their incompetence ok i know by now your sick of me bashing this beloved game , but that 's the thing i love this game and like many others i have had hours upon hours of fun playing this , but i cannot get past the fact that this game is so unpolished and so poorly optimised it really does feel like a badly made console port and i genuinely feel the same anger i had with gta iv way back when the pc version was first released , the random lag or crashing in the middle of the action because the game cant cope with what 's going on and just cries in the corner while all the other games just point and laugh at it , the reason i portray it that way is because it feels like bohemia is dragging its heels and then when it finally has something to give us it overprices it in what is an apparent need for funds which lets be honest makes them look a bit needy i can understand that though , they need money to pay the staff , but what i do n't understand is why they give us so little for our money compared to the like of the arma 2 dlc 's in which we got factions , vehicles , soldiers , weapons and missions all in one dlc package i know the price was higher , but for an example arma 3 helicopters dlc you pay now 08 05 2015 is 10 99 gbp or 16 95 usd i think anyway what your paying for is the privileged honour of being able to pilot 2 helicopters , that 's it , you get everything else for free in an update including the ability to travel in the helicopters , well i suppose that 's good right \? wrong basically they tried to tell us this was some kind of great thing they did for us but in actual fact it was so that it did n't split the playerbase , basically covering themselves from flaming on that aspect but i suppose that means most of the people that bought it are going to be decent pilots , not all but most , yes \? well yes actually , most of the pilots i have flown with flying the dlc choppers are good probably about 70 of time , but that means all the really bad pilots vive had in the past all got better at flying \? or does this mean only the people who bought the dlc were the really good pilots with a few people with spare cash thrown in , but if this is the case then bohemia managed to miss out on a massive cash injection by not putting more choppers into the pack maybe even a custom air force faction for nato and csat its only retexturing some uniforms and some code , its hardly rocket science it takes time sure but still 2 choppers \? its an insult , i just downloaded a mod which gave me 4 choppers and 7 planes with a custom faction , uniforms , soldiers , equipment etc , it took all of 40 seconds to download and hey guess what i did n't spend a penny ok this got way too long way too fast so here , conclusion is this i want to recommend this game because i have had a lot of good memories with it and im sure others will like it as well but at the same time i cannot recommend this game for all its flaws , if your willing to put serious time into modding this game then yes buy it , but as i said i cant recommend this because of it flaws and because of the company behind it , i have lost faith in it and cant recommend you buy this to settle confusion , my pc amd fx 8350 black edition 8 core socket am3 , 4 0ghz , 16mb 4gb xfx radeon r9 290x dd , 28nm , 5000mhz gddr5 , gpu 1000mhz , 2816 streams msi 970 gaming , amd970 sb950 , socket am3 12 gb corsair vengeance ram 850w corsair psu 6x 120mm aerocool shark 15 blade",0.0
"i really hate to say this , but you should wait to get this game until bis gets it finished , assuming that happens the reader should realize that i have almost 2000hrs in arma2 the 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to steam and does n't count the time pre steam so , as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers , not on big public servers as someone who plays mostly cti maps \( remember those bis \? \) , and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying cas in a jet \( remember those bis \? \) , i can honestly say that i'm rather let down by arma 3 and it makes me very sad the interface has always been clunky from way back in ofp and before the new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing it does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff \( novel ! ! \) , and while i appreciate the work here i 'd rather have seen the time spent on other things to be fair , two of the devs did spend time locked up in greece for a stupid reason i think it was 11 months \? this is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason but , i understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two lead devs as i understand it i get the feeling that they got back , and shoved development through in order to compete with the \( then \) new bf and cod releases i personally feel this was a huge , quivering pile of mistake because they are n't really in competition with those games ! ! ! it 'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly all board games sure but vastly different same here ! arma ii was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator though i think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers arma iii seems to go away from this and i think it 's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways maybe i'm wrong \? it just does n't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer for me , the fact that it 's set in 2035 is a hhhhuuuuuuuge turn off and almost a game breaker right there that , and there 's one jet in the game thus far one and it 's some old trainer pos to boot nice well guess this confirms my hunch i 've had for a while now bis seems to hate fixed wing like blizzard hates melee ! it 's all about rotary wing ! which is fine and dandy unless you need an a10 or a spooky by 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out , so where are their replacements \? hell , at this point i 'd be happy with an f15 that i can just fly and do stand off attacks with from miles away oh right that 's what the choppers are for ! am i ranting a bit there \? um , yes sorry , but i was just looking so foward to this game ! ! ! heck i even did the pre order on the delux version ! ! now \? ya i'm kinda not happy about that i fire the game up now and then after i see an update downloading just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a 45 110 every shot it 's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody 's there so , i 'd say to wait on this game i'm still playing armaii where i can fly fixed wings even in the base game oh yes i know mods mods mods ya hangs head",0.0
"poor edition to the armaverse tons and tons of potential that is being sadly wasted the game has nice graphics and lighting albeit not dx11 the main island altis , looks quite impressive indeed but has a very empty feeling and doesnt feel alive like other arma maps did the ragdoll which is one of the new features feels half finished , like the rest of this game if i'm honest an example of this is all static 50cals have the same model and this situation you will see through out the game , the latest content added were reskined with slight model change baf helicopter and vehicle which is unacceptable in book if you already payed for that content if you bought baf for arma 2 the sound leaves very little to be desired , with clipping audio and samples so loud that they actually break up \( tank main guns \) arma and arma2 have infinitely better programmed sound engines arma3 is currently a dead duck in my opinion , anything that is positive about this game is quickly over shadowed by lack of content , bugs , inconsistances in code and i hate to say it but , bordom i never thought i 'd hear myself saying it but yes , this game is boring with the pace of the games meaningful development slower than a snail i 'd venture to say dont expect much soon maybe if the game still lives in 2015 it could be great , but right now it is certainly not that only time will tell if bis take advantage of this games potentials my feeling is that it will fall by the wayside because of lost potential and lack of real core code bug fixes",0.0
"oh arma arma , arma , arma the abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive , and less fun , and all it took was one title one title full of empty promises , and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for dayz 2 let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series , and the company that i used to respect above every other the quick and dirty , would i recommend arma 3 \? not by a mile sub 30 price tag , sure , you 'll get your monies worth but even for all the modders trying to save it , this is not a complete game you should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of community created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product if some of that money went to those modders , then i 'd say support them , not bi but it does n't imagine buying a car , but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately sure the car runs , but just how useable is it \? a quick glance at my steam page would reveal that i highly praised bi 's adventurous approach to arma 2 , and oa i loved arma with a blazing passion , even though it 's considered the of the series ofp shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil sims sure , since ofp , the series has had its caveats and nuances , but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided so where did arma 3 go wrong \? what could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games \( 2 expansions dlc \) \? well , lets start with the company and work our way up you see , riding on the heels of the massive success that dayz was thanks to word of mouth and lps , bi somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most aaa companies do \( incomplete games for full price , dlc strategies \) , could be done to their small communities and you know what \? they were right we all bought into it bi slowly came to realize that they could do less work , and still make more money , because their communities could turn nowhere else what amazes me most about dayz , besides the fact that it is still in alpha after almost 2 years , and that it 's lead creator left , is that all it really did was show what arma 2 was already capable of massive , persistent worlds with mil sim themes just , with zombies but , this is not a review of dayz , this a review of arma 3 any arma community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at arma 3 's feet disguising as the enemy \? gone the railgun tank , one of the coolest features at e3 , and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about \? poof all the underwater showcases , hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay \? nope planes \? we got 3 funny thing is , all you deluxe edition owners should open up that tactics , techniques , and procedures manual it comes with sometime , and view all the planes we should have had the reskinned c 130 and f 35 \? fugetta about it that 's right , we could n't even get recycled content now , let me be fair , arma 3 's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries and ofp arma has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content but vanilla , the games were usually very playable , and very enjoyable this is where arma 3 comes up the shortest while the engine is great , and getting better with each patch , not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content , but the underlying issues since ofp are still there 2013 2014 , we still have an action menu bi , please not to mention that ai has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements , rather than better you know , some people actually say arma 2 people were spoiled because we had ofp and arma 1 's content all rolled into one i find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games who get paid for it in closing i will say this arma 3 , as a game , is complete and total bs arma 3 , as a platform , for people to show their skills in modeling , texturing , and coding , fantastic if you want arma 3 , do it to support people who make great content just do n't expect a full fledged game , for the full fledged price",0.0

"let me start by saying that i have had fun with this game , as you can see by my playtime but that playtime has been plagued by bugs , glitches , low fps , and a constant feeling of why did n't they \? in the back of my mind i never got into arma 2 because of its fps problems , netcode , clunky and unintuitive controls , and just bad game design arma 3 has fixed none of these problems first off , the performance the real virtuality engine is an engine from the ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and server performance still affects client performance this is a joke if the server gets overloaded , you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s this is why performance is so inconsistent the player controller is the same one from arma 2 this controller cannot play more than two animations at once , on the legs and the torso full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this again , this is a joke animations are also very stiff and crappy looking same old bugs and glitches from arma 2 that were never fixed you can lean into walls and see through them , much worse if you 're using 3rd person grass pops in right in front of your eyes objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you vehicle physics are almost non existent and you will explode from the smallest crash voip is incredibly laggy and sounds like it 's coming out of a 90s phone game is supposed to use dx11 when in reality it still uses mostly dx9 , one example is shadows arma 3 still uses stencil shadows instead of soft shadows , even on max settings aside from that , visually the game is nothing special it has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it 's quite ugly low res textures are a problem the game is billed as a military sandbox by bohemia and a military simulation by pc gamer but ing nobody plays it as one 99 of servers are gamemodes like wasteland , epoch , and altis life gamemodes more suited to grand theft auto than a game with as much potential as arma 3 worse still bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless end game gamemode that nobody plays i was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it 's supposed to be , and i played a lot on that server , but the fps was so bad \( 25 \) that i eventually stopped playing stemming from the issue above , tactical pvp just is n't a thing there is some tactical pve which i have enjoyed playing , but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a 45 , you 're out of luck 3rd person everyone uses it , or rather abuses it it 's impossible to get the drop on someone in cqc because he 's looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person do n't play it , you might say that 's impossible , because i have never seen a public server with it disabled do n't use it , you might say again impossible , because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when i come around the corner unless i use 3rd person to look over the wall too updates are a farce game 's been out for 2 years and only now we 're getting bipods , really \? the dlc is another joke , 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns , wow bohemia what a ing deal never half two things whole one thing ron swanson driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that is n't a flat surface plane mechanics are pick up and play guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered does n't happen the only saving grace is the combined arms aspect , but alone they 're terrible to play i'm going to stop here because i could go on all day about how this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all i never write long reviews , but how much i love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me this game is not worth 50 euro , maybe 20 at best the only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game the only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it",0.0

"despite many warnings from the community , bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine , again thus resulting in 90 fps in single player , down to 10 15 in multiplayer , servers ca n't even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server , resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game instead of fixing the ai , glitches and trying to optimize the game , bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above what 's that \? you want single player \? oh well you 'll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those sp episodes , why yes they are free , as they should be , as you have just paid for a 60 dollar alpha oh and the only thing people play in this realistic army sim is a god damn rpg average civi game type where you role play your actual boring life",0.0

"i played this game back when it was the free game for the weekend i never purchased it afterwards , and you 'll probably figure out why from both my review and those of others so , as anyone could reasonably expect , i was pretty excited for this game to be free for the weekend , as i 've had my eye on it for almost a year ! as an avid arma ii fan , i had always been a little dissapointed with the lack of more modern military tech in an otherwise great game i thought arma 3 would whisk all my problems away and carry me into arma heaven it did n't quite work out like that though so upon launch the first thing that struck me as odd was the lack of info sure , the menus are much more appealing to the eye , but the tutorials were some weird lovechild of a campaign and a quest system it was very strange , so much so that i neglected to finish the first one oh well , i thought i 've played enough arma ii to figure out how to handle myself and for the most part i was right i jumped into the campaign and it was fun ! so why the negative review \? well , the campaign was fun for a little bit , but after that 'new game smell' wore off , it was n't much to brag about i moved on , and played some tank match which i ca n't remember too many details about , other than a few key things first off , everything was insanely grey now i understand the use of dynamic lighting and warzone fog and stuff like that , but this was just rediculous so , as i was cruising around with my platoon of slammers , we encountered some enemies ! great ! let 's see how this works ! so to sum that up , there 's unique and dynamic damaged dead unit models depending on their style of demise , the radio chatter no longer sounds like a panicking android but a much cleaner soldier , and vehicle control is no longer a reinactment of the mountain scene in tokyo drift but , what i could n't get over was the lack of diversity oh look , slammers hey , more slammers oh , a wolverine \( i think \) and omg another slammer what i'm getting at is that , unlike its predicessor , arma 3 has no vast , game changing dlcs \( other than karts , but that is n't even military \) so what you end up with is this massive tropical island turned warzone , and you get the same handful of units over and over , which might not matter for ais , but for myself i prefer a diverse choice in my vehicles and other wartime equipment sure , it 's modable , but so was arma ii , and i already know the cool mods for that , which totally redefine the feel of the game so , over all better lighting and physics better voices and immersion diverse factions newer tech to toy around with low diversity of units poor tutorials for those who want to start at the top modernized everything , even when unnecessary \( e g hummingbirds it 's such a pointles change , just give me my little bird ! ! \) virtually no dlcs that expand the battle experience , and the ones that exist are n't worth the cost for the amount of units recieved essentially a more stabil version of a modded arma ii client overall , i would just reccomend saving the money for other stuff , there 's plenty of games on steam , but none of them , not even arma 3 , can match the charm and pure flexibility of arma ii",0.0

infinite modding possibilities \? shut up and take my money , sir ! 4 2 hourrs on my record , i would say at least half was spend alt tabbed googling various how do i do this or arma 3 tutorial since the in game help instructions interface is i do n't know if it is because i 've never played any arma installment , or i'm mentally , or the game is simply an unintuitive cobbled together sack of confusing and unhelpful , but either way , prepare for a heavy learning curve some enjoy this aspect , some people prefer a game with 400 keybinds to take advantage of their expensive gaming keyboards and mice i am not one of them it 's a first 3rd person shooter with sim aspects there should be no need for you to be a contortionist or have a 2nd monitor with a keybind list up at all times honestly , a lot of the keybinds are whacky and frustratingly unintuitive i get it , new things take time to learn like learning a new language like piloting a jet like learning how to script for me , playing a game and learning the controls should be remotely similar to any of these things i do not want to dedicated 20 hours just to be able to navigate gameplay it 's not a mmo hell , i have played mmos with less binds not only that , but for the life of me , i could not get my extra mouse buttons to perform the way i wanted them to arma3 is the only game i 've ever played where that has been the case get ready to spend hours scouring the web for 'fps issues' or 'fps tweak guides' for a game that really is n't incredibly impressive , graphically all the same , it will make you wonder what your 700 video card and top notch processor , 16 gigs ram , ssd hd , etc are ing doing you 'll notice , if you have monitors up on your pc , that they are n't being taxed all that much \( 20 \? \) yet performance is still awful guides will have you downloading cpu parking unparking software , entering a billion command line switches , sacrificing goats to the bohemian pagan gods , but alas , very little you do will change the fact that this game is optimized like a bag of bloody do n't bother searching through forums , 95 of people that do n't recognize there is in fact , a massive persistent issue with fps in this game \( so maybe 20 people on all the internet \) will just ridicule your computer or setup and tell you to get a guhd computer , i get 60 fps , must be a problem with your setup , ! ! ! ! ! etc the campaign is horrendous the ai is bad like , mind blowingly bad your teammates will just charge in , and either kill everything in sight while you 're playing realistically \( taking your time , scouting , moving from cover to cover , etc \) or they will charge in and get annihilated either way , prepare to be a spectator for a lot of the action simply because your character is bound by the realism parameters that both friendly and enemy ai is not examples of this include the enemy have clairvoyant abilities to spot you behind that tree , rock , building , etc and the second you pop your melon out for a little lookie loo , boom , headshot from 300 m from an enemy who isnt even rendered oh , okay , i thought i was fighting human beings , not terminators with cloaking shields woops the enemy ai will have astonishing accuracy unbelievable and certainly not realistic accuracy accuracy that you simply cannot pray to match if you have been moving at all in the last few minutes before you raise your gun try drinking 10 15 beers , then playing that stupid game we did as kids , where you get a baseball bat , and put your forehead to the pommel and jam it into the ground and spin around and around and around for a minute then , pick up an assault rifle and try to aim at something 10 m away , let alone 300m away \( i'm not american , so as kids we did n't have the assault rifles , but the baseball bat spinny thing was a thing , its not just the 15 beers talking \) this is what its like to try to aim down at an enemy after running 15 feet for a game striving for realism yeah this amazing and ultra realisitic military sim mechanic only affects you , in case you were wondering besides the game breaking ai and mechanics and horrid control system and clunky ai and awful on screen instructions the campaign itself is a lot of ho hum lets traverse the country side for 15 mins listening to horrid voice acting \( to be fair , its not as bad as what some people are saying , but its still not good , and considering its the only god damn thing to take your mind off how bad this game is performing on your gaming rig , it just grates on your nerves \) literally , a mission starts , and they have you run from one in game cut sceen to another , with zero action in between , with a few fadeouts , and 15 minutes of walking is this deliberate to bore you to death so that when action takes place , you do n't notice how the ai acts \? perhaps so prepare to traverse the same stretch of not so pretty landscape over and over as the save system is another baffling part of bohemia 's design i understand not allowing you to save whenever you damn well please \( wait no , i do n't \) but making me listen to same uninspired , boring , and inane voice acting while running up the same god forsaken hill for 3 minutes over and over and over because the ai consists of super soldiers who can no scope you 5 seconds after a full out sprint to prone is just infuriating after a while even during firefights , i did not get an overwhelming sense of holy shieeeeet , war is scurry man , this is so realistic , only supreme tactics and skill and will have me come out on top in this conflict it was more like , why the fk am i druken soldier with asthma who ca n't run 5m and raise his weapon without swaying so bad it 's amazing he 's even still standing upright \? more often than not you find yourself letting your ai teammates do everything while you cower in a bush hoping you might get to shoot 1 or 2 enemy soldiers or you allow your teammates to cannon fodder themselves and you mop up while the enemy is busy annihilating them either way , you barely feel engrossed in the action , and never really feel like a main player in the game do n't even get me started on the uav mission to be fair , this is the single player part of the game i have yet to really delve into multiplayer i'm afraid to people state \( numerous times , i might add \) that single player fps is fine but multiplayer is where it really goes downhill oh , goodie when the game is made so inaccessible , it makes it real difficult to start it up again , let alone try playing with other people and getting into the lovely world of arma community friendliness better make another run to the beer store even if you 're not a drinker , spend 30 on booze you will get way more entertainment out of it hell , if you 're really not a drinker , give the booze to a bunch of teenagers or your little brother or something you will be better off for it , trust me",0.0
"a lot of people lead reviews by saying this game has potential which is a really polite way of admitting that , right now , it absolutely sucks it also does not reflect well on the game or on segments of its fanbase that well deserved criticism is met with accusations of being a call of duty fan or a console kiddy or other supposed slurs on the critic 's intelligence i 've been playing this series since flashpoint and y'know , it 's always been bug ridden , poorly implemented , and heavily dependent on its modders to even be playable but the series has been just good enough to be worth the aggravation and massive time sink necessary to make it work until now the ai is horrible for a game that involves realism in combat , where damage is more realistic and is dependent on squad tactics , the ai needs to be competent if not excellent instead , the ai is incapable of navigating the terrain without getting stuck , incapable of responding effectivly to fire and totally lost inside of buildings no , literally , lost inside god help you if your ai decides to use a grenade because he 'll just kill himself the action menu is still in the game and has been combined with environmental add actions that are even worse than in previous games face a door and click the action menu key now watch as you transition to your handgun instead of opening the door because the action triggers are inconsistently placed by an incompetent dev team this has been a major problem since ofp and it 's actually worse now you will lose many many many games , not because you made a mistake or were unlucky , or for legit gameplay reasons , but because the ai is totally and i mean totally incapable of doing what the game depends on it to do the devs have taken to claiming arma 3 is a toolbox \( when they 're not insisting it 's a game not a simulation or conversely , that it 's actually a simulation not a game what they call their game depends on which set of their errors you 're pointing out \) in defense of it lacking a campaign fine but what you get for tools is laughable there 's a handful of armor , vehicles and equipment , but it 's basically just re skinned copy and pastes between factions basically everyone shares assets with superficial cammo differences did you think arma 2 had bad optimization \? well , the dev team topped itself with arma 3 being even clunkier , slower and more bloated seriously , everything about this game simulation when it comes to optimization looks like a rough draft of code rather than a finished product it will slam even high end machines to a halt because of poor usage routines , bad scripting , and other lazy shortcuts what about mods \? well the modding community is a brilliant one , we 've got some really really good people who really should get credit for making arma remotely popular \( or playable \) but bis is depending on modders , not to expand the game , but basically to make the game work no matter how good the mod team is , it 's still less efficient and effective to try to fix a broken ai with an addon as opposed to fixing the core code bis is content to be lazy and coast on its unpaid modders , but there 's only a handful of people who work on ai game core issues \( a lot work on maps and missions , but core realism errors are another matter \) and they seem pretty tired of doing this stuff it 's also a pretty sh t thing for bis to do , to release a full priced game with barely any content , crappy optimization , an outdated engine and terrible ai but then expect the modders to bail them out of trouble well maybe it ai n't gonna happen this time hell , maybe they ca n't pull it off this time , even if they want to tl dr this is alpha quality work at a final version price bis maintains that its games are like fine wine that age well when actually they 're more like cheap wine that you need to take home and mix with fruit juice and a pound of sugar to be in any way drinkable arma 3 is yet another great concept that in practice is totally undermined and destroyed by what is either laziness or incompetence from the developers wait a year from now maybe the modders will fix this lazy incompetent mess and arma 3 will be a playable game like arma 2 until then , just play arma 2",0.0

"after playing this for a very long time i have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game this game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes there are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and they 're all flawed up the gamemode 1 survival \( zombies and wasteland \) zombie modes are boring and wasteland is extremely boring gamemode 2 king of the hill this is the closest thing you 'll get to proper pvp action but the leveling system is beyond awful ! newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits , holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles new players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you do n't get anything good until you reach level 13 which would n't be a problem if the leveling did n't take forever ! then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big xp reward if they win the game , so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win overall king of the hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it , is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours gamemode 3 roleplay its just like darkrp in garry 's mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted police recruitment systems , then they have there police force act like the kgb overall atlis roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable gamemode 4 battle royale i hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock overall community the community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes if you 're looking for the real arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict , only play at set times and do n't like people who are new to the arma series game i could go on for hours about the awful bugs , ui , dlc and price of the dlc but instead i'm going to talk about serious connection problems and the system requirements connection problems even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 you 'll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit system requirements thankfully i have a super computer and i can run this game on ultra settings but this game will go to war with your cpu and graphics card ! i miss arma 2 operation arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like insurgency i miss insurgency it almost brings a tear to my eye edit after searching for countless hours i finally found a co op arma mission people play called annex , its pretty good but this game is still not worth your money !",0.0

"part of the appeal of this game is the realism \( i e ballistics , stamina , environment \) , which positive reviewers rave about the realism makes this the most exciting and action packed pc game i 've ever played the majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides , then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself how did the game know i have parkinson 's \? you 'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field , and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute it 's almost like playing tag with good friends , except for the part where someone gets tagged i did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by , and i'm sure the ai experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another ironically , when well hidden behind a tree or rock \( or other random cover \) and peek around the corner , the ai suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot that 'll teach me for trying to be tactical save points are set within the game , and waypoints are even more predictable , leading to non frustrating replays and non existent monotony there 's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the ai has xray and auto aim , so that 's a relief your squad will most likely make all the kills , and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you also , certain characters have infinite health so there 's no real urgency in helping with firefights time to kick back and let everyone else have fun then there 's the weird controls , which will have you rolling on the floor \( literally \) out of cover right into incoming fire that 's the last thing the enemy expects ! you 'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers , only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface i guess that 's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute as a plus , you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier i forgot to mention that you 'll bleed out and die if you do n't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body that 's actually pretty realistic , since it 's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health as you 're wounded , aim and mobility decrease to the point that 's so real you wo n't be able to contribute in any positive way , except to be cannon fodder for the enemy it 's ok though , when you die you 'll get to respawn with full health but then when you restart the checkpoint , you ca n't fire your gun because there 's apparently a glitch in programming \( or is it \? \) which does n't allow reloading this is great , since the game already saved your progress and you 're stuck with one bullet you ca n't fire anyways the realism is scary i would not recommend this game for 60 , or even on sale for 30 i would wait till the price increases to at least 99 99 , so that way you 'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that 's so realistic , you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience just make sure you 're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete sorry , not illusion simulation",0.0

"i was really hopeful about arma as it is , it was pretty lame maybe it 'd be better if i had a super fast computer , and everyone had the fastest internet known to mankind it is almost as realistic as warthunder , but jumpy , jagged , and with laggy multiplayer some say the controls are confusing , but i do n't agree the controls are a little different , but you get used to them fairly quickly some of the confusion comes from putting more than one action with the same button , switching based on whether it is a tap or a hold i referenced the controls menu a bunch , but there are numerous tutorials , guides , training scenarios and other practice available right in the game i really appreciate how realistic it is in that there are no markers for the enemy , and it only takes a couple of hits to kill you unfortunately , it always takes at least 4 bullets to kill an enemy unless you hit the face the helmet will not do , you must hit the face or neck this is actually pretty hard to do when you are at distances of 100 m , which you usually are engaging at those distances 50m , and when they shoot more accurately than you because you have been walking running everywhere and thus have less fatigue avoid ever sprinting , even though the map is bigger than any map in any other game you 've ever played in , just be patient and take 2 4 minutes to walk to the next battle if you run , you 'll just die tired i went into a multiplayer game and saw helicopters flying around in crazy upside down positions , crashing and falling to the ground perhaps a contributing factor was the fact that it was a 70 person game when i joined , i saw in the chat room that players were complaining about the lag , as i quickly downloaded a 3 4 mb setting file from the server obviously , my joining the game clogged their upstream pipe this happened a couple times in the game as new players joined , lag spiked perhaps a fix of this could be a download mirror used for all servers , or something to save on server bandwidth this game made me laugh at how unpolished it was at several points mostly this was for multiplayer lag jumps , but it was funny when i tried my first multiplayer mission and my trooper , who was not the squad leader , would not stop calling out orders to everyone every 10 seconds i tried figuring out why i was issuing all these commands , but it happened without my pressing buttons or anything close to the squad command buttons it was also funny because the in game voice chat toggle button defaults to caps lock , so when i returned to typing out messages they were shouting half the time oops i couldnt figure out how to stop ordering everyone to regroup with me , nor could i find the enemy \( it was a co op mission \) , so i decided to try something else in my second multiplayer game , i was starting to get the hang of it i died plenty at first , sure , but there was always a nice helicopter pilot ready to take us to the battlefield when i respawned i'm really glad i did n't have to walk all that way , because if i did , once would have been enough for me to quit i was starting to get the hang of it , and even a few kills someone finally got me while from a higher building , and i was returning to the battlefield in a helicopter i started typing to my teammates while riding in the heli , and even though i was typing a message , when i used spacebar during the message , it caused me to jump out of the helicopter without a parachute i died before i could finish typing out my question , but in a way it answered a different one i decided to stop playing multiplayer and try the campaign in the first mission it was funny to have an enemy blazing away full tilt at my essential npc partner , and for him to not even notice the enemy was there , walking on by i would have preferred my ai teammate to actually engage the enemy , but i'm sure walking up and shoulder checking him as he walked by was pretty effective in the same mission , i snuck up on a machine gunner in the same first mission and wanted to see what the action button would do when i got close it turns out , instead of knifing him or doing some other crazy cool cqb maneuver , i pulled out my medical kit and started bandaging him while he turned his mg on my face and opened up in the second mission , i was n't able to progress because one member of my squad spotted an mrap that he really wanted me to destroy , even when our mission did n't call for it the rest of our squad was fine to go to the rendezvous point , but that npc squad member kept yelling for us to take out the group of enemies by it the squad leader kept yelling for him to return to formation , and i just kept walking through the forest for a while , hoping that he 'd return at the next script line for the story he did n't i ended up going back to the last autosave and taking out the rest of them , by myself \( after 20 tries \) , without backup i was a little glad i did , because when allies engage the enemy , they die as fast as the enemy does which is as fast as you do which is quick i never neded up finishing that mission , because even when i knew generally where the enemy was coming from , i could n't see them to shoot them but they sure could see and shoot me through all the leaves and bushes in the forest i died over and over i'm sure it was a bit like 'nam , and just as fun so i decided to uninstall if it were n't for that , the campaign at least has great production value , on par with call of duty the voice acting , scripting of scenes , and music all are top notch it is ready for oculus ir , and maybe i 'd enjoy it more if i had a computer that was n't at least 6 years old i am usually a simulation enthusiast , loving realism even over gameplay \( hey , i like warthunder , where you also have a hard time identifying who is an enemy and you die in 1 2 hits \) however , this was just not very enjoyable arma is like fighting on 3 or 4 battlefield 3 maps at once , with 100 players that sounds fun , and it could be as it is , however , it tries to do entirely too much \( for my computer \) it ends up being a laggy , frustrating mess it 'd be fun

"i approached this like any other game , though i have played operation flashpoint , arma 1 2 before played the campaign , first flaw i noticed is that once the fighting starts in earnest the game 's checkpoint just stops , and it wo n't even let you quicksave for long periods of time as a result you 'll be playing the same sections over and over again unless you 're really good at spotting enemies in janky terrain and shooting them through inaccurate terrain hitboxes really , most rocks early on in the 'survive' campaign seem to need about an extra foot of clearance , so if you use them as cover you 're just wasting your very limited bullets , and i grimly suspect they would have screwed up just as many collision boxes if not more later on in the game the enemies you are fighting in that mission also have some pretty good body armor so you need to accurately put a bunch of 6 5mm bullets on target against targets that are running , using terrain , and do n't have any problem injuring you even having played the prelude i was n't ready for the long stretch of running with occasional dicey battles and no opportunity to save your progress for a good 10 30 minutes fairly early in the survive campaign it would have been sensible to maintain flow for the game to at least allow me to manually save before or after each of the firefights that are about 5 minutes apart of just running \( or 20 minutes of stumbling along if you take a shot in the leg \) requiring a marathon jog through fighting 3 4 decent enemy squads including snipers and machinegunners with only one ally without even the option of saving , let alone automatic saves anywhere in there amongst all the scripted chatter and setpieces that you do encounter , would be fine as an optional challenge but not the start of a campaign where you have to get through it before anything cool happens you do n't even start with a single first aid kit to patch up your leg if you take a round through it , so one unlucky hit and you 'll be staggering between checkpoints instead of a 2 minute sprint for my money i 'd rather buy either something a whole lot more interesting and deep than arma 3 , or something just as simple in theme but with tight controls and good flow for me arma 3 sits in that uncomfortable spot between a simulator and an action game where i'm going to be frustrated by the intricacies and slowness of getting to the action , and then the battles themselves are n't any fun either , especially not with bad checkpointing that said , this sort of game really lives or dies on its multiplayer which i ca n't be bothered with so as a singleplayer game , no , i would n't recommend it if a game 's singleplayer campaign ca n't hold up to scrutiny then it should n't have one",0.0

"another day , another arma game , another load of bugs and lags do n't expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 fps , it will always find a way to ruin your performance i'm constanlty monitoring hardware usage and arma iii lags even while not loading my cpu or gpu above 70 \( i'm running the game on a 6 gb s ssd \) i cannot help but compare this game with battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well i do realize that bf4 is n't running a whole load of ai and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow i feel dice could do optimization much better than bis seriously , what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks \( so it seems \) \? i'm definitely not recommending this game as i'm absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals i 've tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game launch parameters , custom memory allocators , edits in the cfg and ini files , unparking the cpu cores , changing process priority , messing with settings etc all they do is give you a tad of extra fps and nothing more no tweak will change the fact that arma iii uses a 32 bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support on the other note , i do n't really like the pseudo futuristic setting of this game it 's indeed pseudo futuristic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic mid 2030s \? even while not being a mil expert i understand that realistic portrayal \( is n't this what a tactical shooter is about \? \) of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology that 's going to be used at the time scopes with built in rangefinders and auto adjustment \? that 's something already created , greatly promising and not even present in this bogus same as triton oxygen mask , google glasses , smart bullets , thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage \( edit the current version now includes nightstalker scope that has a built in rangefinder \) a3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction that 's not really a major problem since i'm looking forward to mods like ace 3 and rhs escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets , and it 's really good to note that eula and a3 engine allow this the game wields many improvements over arma ii the inventory system is marvellous , radio comms sound much more like live chat , visuals , animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because it 's purely unoptimised \? a3 is too expensive for its content quality , but i may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance however it 's unlikely they ever will the way i see it , in order for arma iii not to lag bis will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of directx 12 with proper multicore support and a 64 bit executable http img leprosorium com 2096814 pathetic performance core usage , ram usage , gpu usage and video memory usage the game barely used 50 of availiable computing power , horrific 22 fps are of course the result the only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy like your silent hill needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking",0.0
"unless you have a half a dozen friends who will play this game with you then i strongly recommend that you do not buy this game it 's all about teams and co operation and it is absolutely zero fun to play on your own you will have no idea what is happening and even worse , you will be at a massive disadvantage while playing because everyone else is in teams usually you will be trekking along \( normally walking for miles since your fully trained soldier can only run about 20 yards before passing out from exhaustion \) you 'll hear a pop pop from two miles away and then you are dead , and will have to make another 20 minute trek back to the battlefield without co ordination with a very sizable squad of friends then you will always fail the game is supposed to be ultra realistic but unfortunately this makes for a very poor game we do n't want to fight long distance firefights against invisible enemies with your gun waving around like you 've got cerbrial palsy just because you jogged down some steps the graphics are definitely good , you 've got to give it that , but the performance is trash if you are playing on low to mid settings then the game will be even more difficult good luck seeing anyone further than 100m away after your lod turns them into blobs literally the only joy i 've gotten out of this game is driving trucks around and flying helicopters , but since this is supposed to be a shooter then that is not good actually fighting other players or even the ai in the campaign is massively frustrating my mexican friend who made me buy this owes me 44 99 this game is worthless",0.0

"arma 3 is easy to explain imagine arma 2 now add proper stances to it , alot better performance , alot of fixed bugs \( alot more introduced aswell \) and on and on arma 3 is a good game for what it is the main problem is the devs are ing lazy , they did n't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2 , instead , 4 or 5 that just have different skins about 1 tank per faction 3 or 4 helicopters and me , only one ing jet i mean thats ing lazy the amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2 bohemia interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc but this game should still either be in alpha , or very early beta not a finished game overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not , its down to you if you want a game that runs and plays really well , if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets , then get it if you ca n't however , just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc again , this game should be in late alpha early beta not a finished game",0.0

"i really want to like this game , but i cant the games mechanics , graphics and the characters competency with his rifle is too far below the average shooter for me to enjoy i find myself yelling at the game to just hold the gun still enough to shoot and find out where my impacts are the character can not hold his rifle still , to save his life ive seen 90 pound women hold them better than the player 's character he feels totally unsupported , like he is floating in the air , even when laying on the ground i'm fighting the character 's complete lack of ability to hold the rifle still constantly any reasonably competent shooter can easily track a target from a prone position without needing to fight the rifle 's weight to stay focused the player never feels grounded zeroing feature is kinda cool if it made a difference ive shot a lot of rifles , and none of them behave like they should in this game the game says that when shooting close , i should aim lower to compensate the reverse is true in real life because of height of the sights over the bore of the barrel if you imagine and draw out an arc , and you sight your rifle to the highest point on the arc , all other ranges besides the one you are calibrated at should be below the highest point this is of course excluding the fact that bullets do n't travel in perfectly shaped arcs a round could travel very straight and flat then gravity wins out and will drag the round to the ground very quickly before 200 yards , as is the case with the ak47 a rifle like the m16 will shoot a very flat arc to 300 yards and can even stay predictably flat enough to make accurate shots out to 600 yards without a problem all of this feels like the game completely ignores or has wrong , so using a weapon system that uses a round i know well makes it difficult and frustrating when the rifle wont do what im asking it to do for a simulator that is bad , very bad the game markets itself as a combat simulator , but i find myself fighting the controls so that much the whole keep it simple stupid philosophy of combat training sorta gets lost in having to press 3 buttons at once to make an accurate shot let alone assembling a drone and using it with any sort of practical use i understand they want certain aspects of the game so a player feels like he actually has to do his job in whatever unit he is in , because everyone has their own roles to play in the war however that is n't how the game plays it would be one thing if the missions were objective based and if you are a drone pilot , your objectives in the campign would be different than say the medic , or support gunner however your role changes from mission to mission , and sometimes even on the fly this causes you to pause the game and read the field manual , so you do n't crash the helicopter and get yourself killed , while in flight or sitting there like an idiot trying to figure out how to put a drone together so you can use it to spot a mortar team on the hillside that complexity would be fine except if i only get a chance to play this game once a month or so , the the particulars of addressing the problem requires me to look them up again so when i forget how to switch to secondary sights on a rifle it isnt a matter of pressing a button , but looking up which buttons to press in sequence hell i could have done that in real life with a simple twitch of the wrist , or adjusting my cheek weld the game would play out smoother if you were to pick a class of soldier to play at the start of the campaign , and played missions with those roles , so you are n't finding yourself learning how to drive a tank when in the last mission you were on foot doing ground recon calling in air strikes i get it , one hero wins the war on his own , but once again if you market it as a military simulator , i shoudlnt have to memorize and be profiecent at the entire game just to play the game , and do a complicted task maybe once or twice in the campagn pilots can play as pilots , officers can play as officers , and scouts can play as scouts it also adds replay value playing the same missions from a different perspective , and learning a new job in the game this game makes my eyes hurt im not sure what it is about it , but something about the lighting effects tends to cause me to have to stop and close my eyes for a few moments ever couple of minutes or so the background blur is so bad i ca n't scan horizons and look for subtle out of place details of a sniper in the brush or look down a street without letting the game 's blurry lighting effects to catch up with what im trying to do , which is hunt the enemy i thought maybe it was my graphics settings at first no , its just how the engine is made i'm not a fan of battlefield 4 , but at least the game is clear , and i can predict ranges and bullet drop its no wonder im squinting all the time , holding the gun up is often like looking down the reverse side of a telescope everything seems shrunk and distant , then zooming down your sights looks how it should have to start with \( especially bad with pistols \) all in all , i feel myself in the mood to play the game , only to find myself yelling at the screen for my guy shooting 15 rounds at a soldier standing upright and facing me presenting a perfect silhouette , and not hitting a damn thing because my rifle is floating in the air if i survive that encounter i find myself looking up which actions to even look up in the field manual just to turn on flir in an apc , because i am now apparently a tank driver at night then i explode because the ai has to do none of this so i go back and play something more satisfying like xcom , or mechwarrior",0.0

"i think the forum post that i made sums it up well tl dr , the game 's community is terrible and the multiplayer is full of mods that barely work , with the occasional gem ruined by the community that inhabits it for a more detailed review of my free weekend day with the game , read below after my dad bought arma 3 i thought i would try it out as well i 've been interested in a realistic modern fps , but they do n't really exist in numbers these days after taking over an hour to install the game , i was able to play the tutorial while tweaking with my video settings i eventually up to over 30 fps while looking really good then i decided i wanted to try the multiplayer out what a mistake that was arma 3 's player base is actually worse than arma 2 's in that every single online server is some reincarnation of the hunger games or dayz without the zombies i spent about 4 hours trying to have fun in these game modes but to no avail , i was playing a really bad set of mods set in a gigantic map that might as well be a copy of just cause 2 's getaway island , all in a modern fps simulator it was like trying to play paintball in playground that was clearly a copy of mcdonald 's playplaces after some searching , i eventually found a domination server , which was as close to vanilla arma as i was going to get it was incredibly confusing , there was no tutorial to explain any of the game mechanics mod additions , and people were wrecking the base 's vehicles i was desperate , so i tried to play anyways after about 10 15 mins of gameplay i noticed that my fps was lagging really badly i had just found a team of coordinated players though , so i just tried to play through the pain after the 5 of us singlehandedly took the next objective , everyone was complaining about fps issues and i was getting 13 18fps there was clearly something wrong , but luckily for us a moderator just got on ! he reset the server for us , which i thought was really nice but it was to no avail everyone was still having fps issues , and i guess that has to do with arma 3 's terrible optimization and or the custom map 's or plugin 's memory leakage filling up our ram then , i encountered a new problem the moderator he was especially grumpy , and clearly over 40 , so being so out of touch with not understanding everything he was getting really upset at all of the new players he understandably kicked a new player that was spamming the minigun on our helicopter even after the moderator told him to stop and then i got kicked for no reason , presumably because i was also in the helicopter \? i came back in , told him that he kicked the wrong guy , and the moderator essentially blew me off whatever , screw him then i found a fob to spawn on that somebody set up on the enemy 's flank i was able to shoot a couple of guys before they shot me off the hillside i spawn back in , and everyone is doing awesomely the enemy has a frogfoot firing missiles and bombs into the city , the warthog is doing the same thing , we had mortars , they had mortars , and i was able to move into the town because it was getting absolutely hammered so i set up shop in a 2nd story window down a street when i spot a couple of soldiers i aimed at thier bodies but could n't see a iff tag so i shot one of them after the other part of this ambushed squad came back out in the open , i shot another one i was unsure about whether they were friend or foe still , so i kept an eye out for server messages in the lower right corner loe and behold , this guy was a friendly , and i just shot him the other guy must 've been a friendly too , which means that i accidently killed 2 of my teammates i immediately said sry on side chat , but it was too late apparently the immature community that seems to make up arma 3 's multiplayer though it would be funny to set up a special plugin for teamkillers whether it was an accident or not , after 2 3 tks you are immediately teleported away from the game and your position in the town to some prison with several annoying soundbites going on in the background , and nothing to look at but other tkers and a really low quality repeated billborad of some kind after i sat there for a few moments , i was also wearing pink clothing that had team killer printed all over it and there was a soundbite of a baby crying , because that 's how annoying the moderators wanted to be in short , i accidently made a mistake , and was punished in the most immature way possible by being imprisoned in an annoying micspam room with nothing to do for 6 minutes wow in every other fps you either lose a bunch of points , get kicked , or are killed by the server in arma 3 the s that run the only close to vanilla server throw you in a prison that forces you to listen to , once again , mic spam that is against the server 's own rules i'm so glad that i got to try this game out this weekend , because i would have regrets had i bought it thank you , arma devs , for letting me experience the tiness that is your multiplayer glad i did n't waste my money on it",0.0

"arma 's popularity stems from the fact that it 's a modern shooter with good modding support that 's it the game itself is heavily flawed and buggy bohemia interactive 's strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half game and letting the modding community fix it sure , there will be some great mods for the game but their success should n't be attributed to arma games like battlefield 1942 , battlefield 2 , and the half life series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them but the games themselves , without mods , were actually competent with the shift to catering towards console gamers , modding support has fell by the wayside , and arma , perhaps unintentionally , fills that gap but arma has horrible ai , horrible physics , horrible performance , a clunky ui , and so on if arma were n't moddable , i'm confident its metacritic rating would be more like 5 10",0.0

"i cannot recommend this game when arma 2 is still alive and well first of all , the game is lacking in content , for example , most of the weapons and vehicles are the exact same for different nations , with different paint schemes the map is huge , which is great , till you look closer at it most of the buildings are empty , no furniture , nothing a lot of the assets are missing , even basic objects buildings for some missions that were around since the ofp days like cti just are n't there the gun handling feels like something straight out of battlefield , if you know how to control the recoil , which by the way is not hard , it basically goes straight up , you can be completely accurate at 300m with a fully automatic weapon the character handling feels very awkward , and this is coming from someone with 2000 hours on arma 2 , i know about awkward controls , there are like 3 movement speeds , all of which take around 3 keystrokes to get in out of , what happened to the good old days of just pressing w then going \? this is n't a damn car , i do n't have to switch gears depending on the speed i am going at speaking of cars , the cars handle very awkwardly aswell , the acceleration is just ridiculous , it takes forever to get up to around 30kmh , then it just switches on the afterburner and off it goes ! hey look , an afterburner ! oh wait , it 's a trainer jet , a stealth a10 , and some freak su25 thingy oh boy there is so much wrong with the planes and helicopters in this game i love aviation , hell i'm trying to make it my job , so this part hurts me the most where do i begin with this let 's start with the easiest , l39 , it 's a trainer , it 's not supposed to carry weapons , and you 're gonna tell me it 's gonna go up in battle with no other air support \? ha , good joke i'm gonna be honest , i like the looks of the su25 looking thing , but it 's never going to happen , much less in 20 years the su25 is still doing well , and if it were to get upgraded in the next 20 years , it would probably only be the systems and avionics , either that , or they will build an entirely new aircraft from scratch , or replace it with the already existing ground pounders oh boy here comes the big one that damn stealth a10 freak there is so , so , so much wrong with this it 's not even funny alright let 's start with what stealthing an aircraft is all about sharp edges to bounce the radar off in a different direction than where it 's coming from , the whole aircraft needs to be sharp guys , not just the engines notice something about the stealth aircraft that are flying around today \? internal stores you do n't want those suckers reflecting radar signals now , do you \? the a10 is a subsonic cas \( close air support \) ground pounder , it is literally designed the enemy up , and they 'll know what hit them , but it wo n't matter cause they 'll either be dead , or their equipment will be too ed up to shoot back there is no use stealthing a plane that will be flying at under 5000' everyone and their mother will be seeing that bad boy it 's also supposed to take damage , the whole titanium bathtub and whatnot , by sharpening the edges , you are adding more structural failure points in the event of , you know , a missile hitting it i'm no aircraft engineer , but to me this makes sense , if someone is reading this and actually is an aircraft engineer , please tell me how wrong or right i am same goes for stealthing helicopters i mean come on , how are you going to stealth a ing rotor spinning at hundreds of rpm , and constantly changing pitch angle \? the mi48 this is not how things work , you ca n't take 2 choppers , merge them together and add some stealth on it and expect anyone to take you seriously arma 3 is set in the near future around 20 years from now if you look at military history , in the 20th century progress was at it 's peak in ww2 up to vietnam , and then kind of slowed down till the mid 90 's , and we 're now more or less at a standstill we 're still using tanks , aircraft , and weapons designed in the 70 's and 80 's and perfectioned it takes a world war or some major conflict of some sort to get us off our asses and to put our thinking caps on so do you really think that 20 years from now , the ak 's , m4 's , m16 's , etc will be out of service and replaced by a new standard of 6 5mm caseless shells \? that we wo n't be still using abrams , strikers , t90 's and bmp 90 's \? we 'll probably have the f22 , unfortunatly probably the f35 , pak fa and others , most of this stuff will most likely be old with fancy new systems i half blame dayz for how this game turned out dayz is was a good mod game , but it attracted the wrong kind of people to arma , it did n't attract milsim people , it attracted the general public that likes shooters and zombies the funny thing is , most of the dayz servers you find on arma 2 are those stupid 10000 vehicles ones with military weapons in every corner and everyone shooting everyone else in chernogorsk , that 's not survival , that 's just glorified deathmatch , either way , i digress bohemia probably decided to make the game more accessible for those people , leading to this casualized shadow of what was once great i could let the whole 'it does n't seem finished' part slide if they were n't releasing dlc for the parts that are n't finished you are expecting me to pay 15 bucks for 2 helicopters \? when there are barely any in the base game to begin with \? and i do agree that all of the future bs thing that i 've been saying can be fixed with mods , but modded servers are not popular , and the most modding the general public wants to do is grab one of those all in one mods like dayz tl dr it 's a casual version of arma 2 , designed to cater to the general public if you want a military simulator , i 'd recommend arma 2 over this if you feel like arma 2 was overwhelming , then this is probably the game for you",0.0

"this really is a poor game and should not cost 36 , here 's why 1 \) recommended system specs are a lie i could not run the singleplayer campaign above 30fps at 1024x768 , lowest everything including draw distance with a fx6300 and hd 7770 false advertising , and also extremely unreasonable hardware requirements fanboys will tell you arma 3 is super advanced etc so demands a lot of the cpu , but i believe it 's just poorly optimised you can have a lot of units moving about and framerates will stay smooth but as soon as people start shooting performance plummets , so i believe it 's something to do with badly optimised effects , not demanding ai \( which is pretty poor in any case \) multiplayer performance is even worse and when 20fps is considered 'normal' it 's effectively unplayable people should not accept 20fps due to game restrictions and the dev 's ought to really address this 2 \) gameplay is terrible so bad that it feels like it 's buggy rather than poor design decisions jogging for about 10 seconds will cause you to start panting and creates extreme weapon sway maybe they are trying to simulate a wall e future of fat soldiers \? again , really kills the gameplay considering the size of arma 3 's missions which require a lot of moving about recoil on weapons is ridiculous and feels like your guy is shooting with only one hand with the gun held sideways damage is ridiculous , enemy targets will take 2 headshots and some more chest shots to be brought down it all adds together to completely kill immersion and makes the game feel like a chore 3 \) immersion again , keeping in mind how bad the shooting mechanisms are , the ai are utterly gamebreaking as well you can empty a clip of bullets in a relatively small 1 meter area around an enemy target he will not budge , he will not flinch , he will just keep on shooting you until you die , and you probably will die because of the awful recoil system in place which makes aiming for the player impossible the ai are basically terminators who will simply run about from time to time , stand still and then shoot you to death there is a mod which reduces recoil , and with this mod a player can mow down these ai like fish in a barrel simply because they do n't move once they 've decided to stop and shoot you 4 \) content really really lacking okay , they have a single player campaign \( which is pretty dull \) but what 's really bad is that they seem to have left a lot of the content up to the community to develop there is no ambient combat module in the editor , unlike arma 2 , there is no specops module in the editor , unlike arma 2 , there is no quick mission creator , unlike arma 2 this makes a huge difference in the game because it means if you want to actually experience the sandbox of the game with ai , you have to either 1 \) create relatively complex scripts yourself or 2 \) download other missions or mods it 's not a pick up and play game which is disappointing considering arma 2 was arma 3 just goes wrong in so many ways , from the gunplay , to the ai , to the stamina and damage system \( basically every aspect of a fps \) and the lack easy to use content such as an ambient combat module or quick mission creator , to the incredible system requirements it really is not worth 36 and , while the futuristic setting is very appealing and graphics look nice , there 's no real reason to get this over arma 2 which is much better overall save your money !",0.0

"this is more of an infantry simulator than a computer game it 's an fps but with flight sim controls and realism the tutorials are called showcases , which is not at all helpful or descriptive if you 're coming to this for the first time you 'll likely make the same mistake i did and try to do the campaign first the sim itself is insanely hard the realism means you 'll often come under almost instantly lethal fire from shooters who are completely invisible to you , and that 's just in the tutorials even when you can see the enemy , they 're often dots on the horizon who can nevertheless pick you off behind cover with unerring accuracy ammo is incredibly restricted , meaning i was actually glad when one of my team got killed because it meant i could resupply there may be a way to get resupplied without your teamates dying , but like so much of this game , it is not obvious how to accomplish that the controls are far from intuitive it took me the better part of an hour and some editing of the control menu to get the gun optics to actually come up reliably when i clicked the right mouse button much of what you are supposed to do happens through the order menu i think you 're meant to use this \( maybe \? again , it is n't clear \) to order npc team members to do stuff , like attack a particular target , but it is far too unweildy to use in combat to select the order menu you have to press '0' or ' ' ' ' did n't work and the font chosen means it is n't obvious if you should be typing 'o' 'o' or '0' it 's zero , btw , but zero on the number keys at the top of the keyboard zero on the keypad does something else the keys can also do different things when modified by alt and ctrl in the middle of a firefight where you die instantly to targets you ca n't see navigation seems straight forward until you try and apply it and realise that waypoints do n't actually appear in your hud , or maybe they do and i just do n't know which button menu item to select to make them visible even the inventory system is overly complex if you try and loot a corpse you have to loot each individual part of their kit separately \( clothing , webbing and pack \) not realising this for the first hour and a half contributed substantially to my shortage of ammo i 've tried the campaign and the first 2 showcases i ca n't complete the 2nd showcase , because on the rare occasions i do n't get insta killed by the hostiles , the anti aircraft missile is unguided and i do n't have the knack for hitting moving targets with it i 've died at least 100 times so far , 20 of those to land mines , which are also invisible a punishing exercise in misery and frustration not recommended",0.0

"worst arma game in history it feels more like cod or battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really did n't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like vtol planes when you fly really fast i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50 cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another lmg finally the nato forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the opfor and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes , helis and ifvs is terrible there should be more ifvs than tanks and thats not the case , if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 mbts and a ifv im more likely to take a mbt and 2 ifvs im patroling not trying to take an airbase those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3",0.0

"the game looks good , the audio is fantastic and the style of play when considering other fps is very authentic the mission designs and training are great and well thought out i can clearly see why many people are taking to this game franchise as it provides a much more realistic diversion then one would get from cod etc so why am i giving this a negative review \? because this game does something with its control format that i just do not like in an effort to make the game more realistic the developers provide too many customization options for the keyboard it took me roughly 1 5 hours to tweak the controls to the point where it was halfway playable and even then because you have a button for what feels like everything , it isnt smooth i know some will disagree with me but despite the unrealistic approach to the cod etc franchises one thing i feel they always get right is how intuitive they make the controls feel that is really the best way i can describe it i can say from experience that with enough training and practice weapons manipulation , tactics , movement etc becomes second nature and smooth despite the chaos that a battlefield provides it has to be said this game gets most things right , but whatever fun or joy there is to be found in it \( in my opinion anyway \) is taken away by an overly complicated controls layout",0.0

"this game is an interesting concept , but is not for everyone it is a modern military simulator , and it does this pretty well tiny little nuances of the miliary experience show up leaning around corners to aim , having spotters for sniping , and switching fire modes on a gun , and healthy amounts of bullet drop are all things you will have to get used to those things are n't that bad , and some can even be fun especially the artillery targeting computer , which has a maximum range well beyond the edge of the map , has different types of shells , and shows how long the bullets with take to get to their destination \( and it will take time if you shoot from one end of the island to another sometimes , however , these nuances can just get annoying the keyboard is cluttered with keys assigened to different things in places that do n't make much sense \( let 's just say i was n't expecting to have different buttons for my watch , my compass , and my very real map \) there is no typical first person shooter radar , showing where enemies or self made waypoints are \( although mission waypoints do show up \) long story short , this game is incredibely complicated to control , and will not be controller friendly the big draw for me , and for most people after seeing reviews from people like nerdcubed , will be the map editor appearently this is what the game 's developers were expecting as well , because the game did n't even come with campaigns at launch \( they are being added as dlc over the next few months \) the editor is incredibely detailed , to the same extent if not more than the rest of the game unfortunately , it is even more user unfriendly particularly concerning non physical items like spawnpoints and mission objectives some of these require you to close the game entirely and edit the text files for the scenario other things like controlling where you want units of the map to go and who they will attack is another mystery entirely the learning curve is a monstrosity i'm not particulary concerned about graphics , but this game is pretty underwhelming in that respect it 's textures are uninspiring , and driving physics are woeful where the game makes up for this is in scale the game is freaking huge it will take and uncomfortable long time to cross , even in a helicopter i believe the estimates are something like 270 square kilometers of space in other words , very very large , and possibly of the largest maps of any game it is pretty empty , but there are some small towns , churches , and all sorts of terrain to give a lot of creative leeway when designing a scenario if you can figure out how if you know to are willing to code , and have a lot of free time on your hands , arma iii could actually be a lot of fun but for everyone else it 's probably best that you do n't fork over 60 dollars for something it takes dozens of hours to fully comprehend",0.0

"this is actually a really good , innovative , and realistic game but i give this a 'no' due to the lack of server with good pings i live in indonesia and the nearest available server in my country is china with 200 350 ping uninstalled it after i realized i wo n't be able to play a single multiplayer game from indonesia pros super realistic in almost every single content stunning graphics fun multiplayer games \( never plays it but saw it at youtube \) lots of cool mods from the community you can use vehicles rather than just being an infantry like in other games you can create your own levels cons extremely confusing controls the single player campaign is really hard to beat i got killed over and over by stepping on mines which are invisible it seems the devs ignores the difficulty of the campaign and only allows us to save once every level they should offer cheat mode i do n't get any fun from playing this game only frustration my multiplayer 's dead and my single player 's impossible to beat if you 're from asia , do n't waste your money on this game",0.0

"i dont really know what to say about this game i perfectly understand that some people may like it but i know that i certainly did n't basically if you 're not a hardcore military fanatic do not buy it the main problem i had with it was that i bought it thinking it was a more realistic battlefield with bigger maps and more accuracy concerning vehicles , weapons , weapon mechanics and that stuff and as you probably know , because you are n't me , it is n't first of all , the game mechanics themselves are in my opinion faulty and sluggish it doesnt feel like you 're in control of your character , whether youre controlling a vehicle or the character himself the ui is the worst i have ever seen in a game especially when it ocmes to looting one of your victims then , the ai is completely bugged overpowered , in the singleplayer campaign \( which is ridiculously bad btw \) i was grenaded by enemies from 300m away the multiplayer is bad too because servers are very badly managed and end up with your spawns being so far from the war zone that you spend most of your alive time in a chopper to get to the warzone and then end up getting killed after 2 minutes on the ground by a camper in a building who knows the map better than you and trust me , this gets very frustrating after a while , it just becomes a cycle of death long helicopter ride death long helicopter ride , etc the only context i would recommend buying this game is if you have maybe a squad of a friends with the game and mics who will play with you in co up community made missions but that 's pretty much it",0.0

"if you were the smart shopper that decided to read reviews before by this game , congratulations you already outsmarted me i bought this game because i had imagined something relatively like battlefield or call of duty but on a much larger and more realistic scale well instead , i got an overly realistic , laggy , impossible campaign game that breaks if you try to play 1 mod personally , i would not recommend this game to anyone i found absolutely no enjoyment in this game i 've played with some friends on a wasteland server and it was fun until it became minecraft faction servers in which case you build a base and wait for it to get raided while spending days trying to find someone else 's base just to return and find that an x ray modder has already taken it out if i was given the opportunity to get a refund for this game , i would in a heart beat the campaign is impossible even on the easiest difficulty because 1 the guiding voice \( example world at war sniper mission with reznov when he tells you to wait for the bombers \) gives you the most basic and obscure directions and expects you to figure it out \( i e the mortar team in the forest finding the mine detector \) , 2 the hostile ai will drop you in less than 3 shots and you 'll never know where they came from and just keep respawning at a check point and trying to find a way to get past them without dying , 3 you 're friendly ai can and will die in combat and the medic rarely heals anyone or tries to revive anyone multiplayer was n't as bad as long as you were among friends a friend and i would play zeus \( a gamemode in which one player is able to do anything while the other players just play and wait for the zeus player to do something \) and mess around with vehicles the vehicles were probably the only thing about the game that i did n't hate except for the artillery there are no instructions or help tips or anything to help you fire the artillery vehicles there is no hit indicator as to whether the shell even made contact with the ground or hit four miles to the right of the target the aircraft are another thing i hated mostly because the were nearly impossible to fly if you tried landing a jet or a helicopter , you were better of grabbing a parachute and hoping for the best because more than likely the aircraft was just going to explode on contact with the ground even going less the a half of a mile per hour so overall , i would rate this game 2 10 just because not all of the vehicles and gamemodes sucked",0.0

"tl dr game is gud , dlcs are unbalanced i have been a fan of bohemia interactive after the whole arma 2 dayz mod craze , i purchased and played arma 2 operation arrowhead and played the dayz mod and base arma 2 year or two later arma 3 came into beta for 29 99 naturally i purchased it after how much i loved arma 2 it showed so much potential , i fell in love with arma 3 the game came out of beta a year or two later not a whole lot added but the core mechanics were there april 1st 2014 , the karts dlc came to be , offered fun little karts for 4 99 , still accessible with out paying that fee november 4th 2014 , the helicopter dlc came out , offered new helicopters which i was very excited about i did not have the dlc at the time but i was playing king of the hill and someone spawned in one the new helicopters i was really infactuated with it , i went up to it to check it out and all i got was a little window telling me to purchase this dlc to have access to this content i was a little upset but understandable its dlc it is now april 11th 2015 the new marksmen dlc just came out and i played it for the first time in a while me and my buddy hopped on the new end game ctf game mode , everything seemed fine headed out to secure the intel i hear a lot of distinct gun shots the new vss vintorez and the 338 lmg that i fail to remember i spot an enemy down the street from me near the objective i take cover , and then peek him with my vermin 45 acp submachine gun i take 3 shots at him , he is hit notices my position aims and shoots me once in the body and i am immediately dead annoyed i respawn and head back out to gather the objective \( intelligence \) the site has been cleared and me and three guys move in i round by a corner and see an enemy player crouched in a firing position i switch to fully automatic and spray my whole magazine into him \( i mean why not \) his player model visibly displays the damage done , and yet the man still lives ! he turns to look at me with his large lmg \( chambering the new 338 caliber round \) and puts a round straight into my chest once again im put to the respawn screen yatatata shoot more dudes , kill a guy \( miraculously \) and attempt to retrive his fire arm a little window pops up telling me to purchase the dlc to have access to this weapon at this point i was rather upset , learning i cant use the new weapons without purchase of dlc , the devs even stated the game was lacking something in terms of weapons so this was created so for something that should have been a free update \( kind of like the weapon resting and face paint etc \) i am quite livid , these weapons completely change the dynamics of fire fights and weapons in general with these weapons chambering such large caliber rounds every kill requires 1 or two rounds to kill an enemy how is it fair that because someone paid 15 99 they can decimate infantry as well as vehicles , one of the new dlc lmg 's that chambers 338 can destroy almost 3 stryders with one belt so thats really fair that people who bought the dlc have access to weapons capable of destroying the planet while im here with my on my hand",0.0

"tons of bugs , the ai is horrible , the enemy ai can shoot your off from across the map , commanding the ai is a , trained soldiers ca n't keep their weapon still after sprinting 5 meters , c 3po has smoother movement than the player i know this is a milsim but it does n't play like a sim at all , controls are confusing and there is too many of them and they 're spreads across the keyboard making me feel like i have to use both my hands on the keyboard it feels like i'm trying to fly a spaceship , not make a human do simple everyday movement yes i know i can place my own keybinds but what 's the point of making the controls stupid like this in the first place \? flying planes and choppers seems to be harder than it was in arma 2 , i'm not sure if anything is changed or if it 's just been a long time since i 've played arma 2 so i'm not gonna criticize that as far as tanks and other land vehicles go it has the same problem as controlling the soldier , stiff and confusing , and the instructions are n't really helping if you like the feeling of actually having control of the charcter you 're playing do n't get this",0.0

"arma is still clunky frustrating innaccurate garbage , i like the scale , bullet drop , and the selection of weapons vehicles that 's it , but interface and interaction is recycled junk , the immersion is ruined by the inaccuracies of the game cant jump , cant climb fences , cant run more than 4 feet without dying of exhaustion , etc ca n't effectively interact with your environment , ai is the worst i have ever seen in any game since goldeneye for n64 , engine is horribly inefficient and clunky \( i can run it at maximum settings with 60 fps no problem but it dose not look as good as it should for the load it puts on ones pc , and it dose not even use all of my cpu gpu to do it , it is not a simulator it is a frustrating exercise in lazy coding , and very poor interaction , the inventory system is garbage and ruins immersion all they did was add new models and up the poly count compared to arma 2 , they need a smoother feel of interaction in their games , and no 3rd person view , whats the point in making a game realistic when you can switch to this magical 3d camera , and you spend a lot of time digging through menus , rather than playing a game bf4 with more animations timers for actions would be more realistic and a basic inventory system would smoke armas broken if ea where ever to make a game world in the frostbyte engine that is that large arma is a slow clunky bore fest that kills any allure of a tactile feel with the hobbled game play and clunky unrealistic mechanics , this game should only be played with a group of friends , and w mods that fix some of this is the only way to go even still it is pretty bad that the modders and gaming community have to be relied apron to make the game better because obviously bohimian do n't know how to innovate and the ridiculous aiming sway is beyond the most , and the most inaccurate thing i have ever seen because when i was 13 years old i could reliably hit targets out 150m out with iron sights , on a 15 year old 308 , and the characters in arma have a furious shootout 50 100m without hitting or the sway going crazy ! and this is with bleading edge tech in both their weapons and sighting systems , and a soldier with years of training and experiance and i am no expert marksman , do n't believe me take a trip to the range it is n't that hard to prove me right here",0.0

"have to ammend my recommendation after making it almost enitrely through the campaign why almost and not completely \? this game has the most awful ai i have experienced in a long time it 's honestly at a point where the enemy ai are either expert snipers , with any weapon at any range , or are completely ignorant and stand in the open waiting to die realism is entirely gone from the firefighting , which is ironic considering this is supposedly an ultra realisitc war simulation the customized difficulty controls consist of two sliders , precision and accuracy at 40 for example , the ai will not let you win a firefight , period at 30 they are so dumb they miss 80 of their shots and are basically waiting to die the only inbetween is 35 which is much closer to professional sniper even when using a 9mm pistol than normal guy who sometimes can hit you it 's pretty absurd , frankly , and almost comical when they market this as a simulation i wo n't even go into the friendly ai it 's so bad it 's become a joke and meme at this point there are dozens of modders who have tried to address the issue , which is fine , but the fact that the team ai is so bad after years of patches says a lot about the developer 's priorities i can no longer recommend this game unless you can tolerate your team standing straight up in the open , running in circles , firing recklessly into the air , or missing every single shot without a single way to control them or help in the middle of a fight this sounds ridiculous , but i was intentionally killing or letting my team die just so i could finish missions not sure how this game is so positively reviewed , honestly it 's like they did everything right , except the important parts cannot recommend",0.0

"eh i'm gonna plug away and play this to the end someday , but even if you buy it now and are n't affected by the fact that the initial release contained maybe one fifth of the final content they slowly leaked out to users , there are still so many issues with this game that it 's not really that fun to play yes it 's realistic i suppose , if you do n't count the fact that you can be shot in the face by a man with the vision of an eagle and the aim of a robot , who is so far away or hidden behind bushes that you ca n't even see him , but it 's not fun to play consider the mines in the forest of the second level that you ca n't detect , and kill you , forcing a checkpoint restart and a frustrating trial and error progression through the area again and again consider the checkpoint about 5 minutes along from that one that is placed at the start of a 3 minute march , followed by a battle that , if you die during it , makes you start back at the beginning of the eventless 3 minute march consider these issues exacerbated by the manual save system that only lets you save at certain times , effectively dooming you to long endless stretches of replaying and replaying until you can slog through whatever ery they stick in front of you consider the poor optimisation that leaves the game chugging on a high end pc , and still displaying all kinds of low res textures anyway consider the frequent updates that corrupt your save files and render them unplayable consider the lack of a co op campaign one of the few things that made the buggy mess of arma ii fun , and literally the only reason i bought this game in the first place perhaps i should have done my research , but then perhaps i had no idea what the total content of this game would contain when it bought it and was shocked to find it bare bones , until they released the last of it months after i purchased it in some ways it 's a vast improvement over its predecessor it looks much better , and the confusing and encyclopedic control system is explained much better the mission objectives are also a lot clearer , and completing a given mission is n't as much of a 'pray that you 're in the wrong place rather than that the game as bugged out' scenario but i still i do n't know what bohemia were attempting with this so many design choices leave me tearing my hair out in frustration \( why on earth would it take them months after release to add a tutorial section to the game \? should that not have been one of the first pieces of content released \? \) however , i suppose that most of my gripes regarding content have been resolved at this point , so at least that 's a plus for those considering whether to buy , but all the odd little design quirks combine together to make playing this game a minefield in itself one wrong move and you 're ed i do not recommend this game",0.0

"this is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming , this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things this is the kind of line you 'll find in most positive reviews of arma 3 the thing is arma 3 fails miserably in every single front involving both 'the finer things' and the basic things bi studio decided to use an ancient patched up engine , used since the times of the operation flashpoint you 'd think the bright side of this is they used the saved money and resources to put everything into solid focus on most important aspects of a 'military sandbox' they claim they 've dished out long story short they did n't arma 3 is not actually worth a comprehensive review so let me show you some of examples of how bad execution you can expect in every single corner of the game ironically , the praised mods greatly expose arma 3 as a game that does n't provide even a basic set of properly implemented essential features what the dayz developers achieved with the engine also show what kind of bad apple arma 3 is performance arma 3 has already become legendary of it 's poor optimisation within the gaming community the game has completely inadequate system requirements to what it presents even taking into account some little simulation \( unlike by the common opinion \) under the hood all of it topped with lack of proper use of multi core processors just one of the forum topics on the subject http forums bistudio com showthread php \? 147533 low cpu utilization amp low fps damage and wounding model i knew it was n't perfect but what i saw and read left me in awe a 'military focused sandbox' , 'military simulation' so you 'd think the model is at least solid , right \? if so we could as well call return to castle wolfenstein a military sandbox fear 1 would be something arma 3 could only aspire to to put it simpler the model is non functional you can shoot a man in a freakin' finger few times and he will die you can put a bullet through the back of a knee of a man and he will only flinch helmets protect whole heads uniformly \( yup , including the face ! \) , bp vests protect the entire torso uniformly to put it into perspective some of the damage and wounding aspects of arma 3 are worse than those in the decade old operation flashpoint \( same developers \) see http forums bistudio com showthread php \? 168548 damage system sucks fix needed p 2784549 viewfull 1 post2784549 ai not a trace of human like behavior in a close quarter engagement if you put bullets into ai 's arms it will only flinch slightly first , second , third flich , flinch , flinch and the he 'll kill you with a perfect head shot , without any delay ai also simply 'is n't bothered' to survive ai under suppressive fire \? no problemo for ai ! see http www armaholic com page php \? id 23969 sound you 'd think sound location \( spatialization \) would be important for developers of a 'military sandbox' \? you pretensious brat ! arma does n't use any sort of spatialization by now you should already know better you should n't expect positional audio of any sort \( hrtf , binaural , rapture3d 7 1 surround is not positional audio \) the game does n't even do the basic stereo panning on many sound samples \( sic ! \) it 's unplayable for me without dolbyheadphone enabled in the preferences of my asus xonar to top it off , if you imagine a certain situation should involve 20 audio samples \( steps , equipment 1 , equipment 2 , wind , ambient , birds , door opening , squad mate unholstering his pistol \) you can cross off about 10 of those to get a feeling of how rich the arma 's audio environment is 'erm so maybe the potential \? ' until there will be a copy of 'arma 's potential' for sale i 'd like to stick to evaluation of what i see even if i give it some slack it does n't really make the picture more bright arma has been released a year ago fundamental aspects of it by all signs need rewrite or ground up implementation , which is n't even on the horizon you plan on giving feedback and asking on the forums the only thing you 'll get is a slap in the face in a form of a shopping cart dlc , women dlc , real sea streams dlc or maybe latin america forces dlc",0.0

"still horribly unoptimised a year now and it still runs badly random hardware configurations of less powerful systems sometimes outdo those of very powerful rigs most of the work done in game is done over 1 core therefore very high clock speeds will benefit over multi core , low frequency setups according to b i , but this is not necessarily true since some people find that the game is not properly utilising their cpus to the fullest extent i beat the recommended requirements but regardless of settings , tweaks , etc the most i can get is 40fps at 1080p i 've waited patiently for over a year now and still this game runs very badly , regardless of settings , drivers , os \( tried win 7 , win 8 win 8 1 \) sadly 40fps is a generous mark since when heavy action occurs the frame rate typically tumbles i have a core i5 2500k at 4ghz and a his radeon 7870 iceq x 1100 1250 unfortunately this game is pretty much unplayable for me and has been since i pre ordered it during the alpha stage apart from single player missions being added after release and some bug fixes here and there , performance issues are still a big problem for many people unfortunately biased people with a love for arma will disregard this review and vote negatively they believe that because their performance is fine , that this review is untrue and therefore deserves a thumbs down this does n't take away the fact that the arma engine is incredibly inefficient and unoptimised and does n't take away from the fact that in many reported cases , weaker systems have better performance over beast rigs with very high clock speeds , core numbers and multi card configurations again this is n't always the case but it has been reported on many occasions and highlights just how unoptimised and hit n' miss the engine is the gameplay is good , the performance is not buy it at your own risk do not childishly downvote this review just because you have a blind passion or appropriate setup for this game",0.0

"the only way i can describe the inner workings of this game is to envision a car junkyard now imagine throwing a giant white sheet over that junkyard and painting nice colors on it thats what arma3 is just unnaceptable for a 2014 title i ca n't believe how poor this game 's engine and game mechanics are it 's just shocking to look back 16 years at games like delta force 2 in 1998 and think that this is actually worse there is so much erratic behavior as a result of poor engine mechanics it is not even possible to even pretend to try fixing them all after looking into it i discovered that this game uses the same exact base engine as operation flashpoint from back in 2002 the same engine that arma1 uses , arma2 , and now arma3 it 's like trying to re use a 50yr old boat trailer meant for 13ft boats on a 100ft yacht it 's just lazy and unacceptable i even read a huge article about how the actual developers of the game confirmed that the engine does not utilize multiple cpu cores and why would it \? the engine is ancient and just heavily modified \( i know this is the part where you argue and toss out comments like 'ohh but you didnt type in the command parameter 8 threads or something shallow like that \) that does nothing if a game is not hard coded from the base engine to unload different tasks onto different cpu cores than it does not make any difference if the game can recognize multiple cpu 's or not \) arma2 had much better graphics in terms of realistic color pallette if you ever look at arma2 screenshots or dayz videos , it actually looks real and there is so much in the way of woods trees bushes and other vegetation in arma2 to the point where you genuinely feel like you are in the woods arma3 's colors are unrealistic and just plain fruity arma2 was more acceptable as a 2008 9 product do you remember all of the different maps in arma2 \? do you remember the thousands of different structures in terms of houses outhouses farms industrial machinery what does arma3 have \? it has one map stratis and the other map is no different so please do n't tell me arma3 has two maps when it just recycles the same terrain from stratis",0.0

arma 3 is mechanically and graphically better than arma 2 the problem lies in the fact that there is far less content and extreme preformance problems on amd systems i simply cannot recommend this game due to the many problems in preformance,0.0

"may 9 2015 i compare those two games because i believe a game 's review score should matter by comparing it to the best games also both are fps 3prson , so i believe while the temathics are different it is the gameplay that matters note my specs are above recommended for arma 3 arma3 30fps small car variety weapon variety is good weapon gameplay is good gta 5 60fps big car variety weapon variety is great weapon gameplay is medium still arma 3 is more complex \( unnecessary \) , bad optimized \( after all this time \) , and well not that impressive after all this time i still cannot recommend it how it feels for me is inferior and boring i put gta 5 here because it 's popular and in perspective to how much they add in a city and still make it work at 60 fps in arma 3 you see mostly empty cities or a base here and there , witch makes me think what fun is there if everything is empty and still kills your fps final score 5 10 it 's a good game i do n't doubt that , but the fun goes away like a car passing fast in front of you if you do n't have any friends to play with , it is a do n't buy",0.0
very bad game how realistic is to miss 30 times 100m away enemy \? \? i played damned airsoft where i could hit 50m away opponet with first bullet when you hit enemy it jumps in air just like in the movies you are moving with same speed while you are crouchhing or standing wtf \? also graphics look ugly and performance is bad bf4 is bad game but it still better than this if you want realism go for insurgency,0.0

"worst game , scam , fraud faulse information be cautious do n't let the pre release trailers and new ones do you over here 's what they said you could do but you ca n't 1 \) they said you could take the enemies outfit and clothing and wear it and disguise your self as them sneak into base and not get shot of you 're not seen or caught doing the crime no you bloody cant 2 \) everything about sneaking into bases is a lie , it 's not even implemented into the system 3 \) they even said , they were not planning on releaseing fixed wing aircraft into the game , but because people made mods and were going on about it , after so long they actually released them prove this game is n't a simulation it 's a screw over version of arma 1 2 and operationflashpoint series 4 \) phsyx \? what they wont show you or tell you is how bad and disgusting it is , example you 're driving a main battle tank , you deside to drive through a small less than a meter high wooden fence the tank maybe or will either 80 chance , 1 break , 2 blow up 3 become badly damage , 4 become partially damage 5 you take health damage same with driving it into a bush or a tree , same with cars , oh and you ca n't drive road baries over or the run way ones you 'll just blow up lol same with the off roaders and massive trucks top cons about this game disguse physx lack of trucks tanks fixed wings fixed wings planes badly made , they tilt like hell wont even fly in straight line ca n't call airstrikes or support like arma 2 or arma oa missions are crap and short delux and limited edition thought they said all dlcs free this is a scam and a lie you 've got to pay for carts good things \? not really much , improved graphics , improved actions and charractor movements",0.0

"overall , this game is not an enjoyable experience due to several key factors the foremost being the enemy ai which are unbearably difficult to fight a lot of the time it seems the game will put nerfed teammates with you againsed enemy ai that are impossible to fight againsed with the weapons and equipment provided the game will often put you in positions where you are on your own againsed impossible odds not in the fun , challenging way either more in the way that you 're laying in a field by yourself , being bombed , while having to take down several enemies at long range with unsilenced weapons with no cover \( keep in mind that these ai spot you the second you fire a weapon and will 1 shot you instantly \) the only reason you should purchase this game is for the mods and multiplayer this game 's optimization is absolutely terrible , so unless you have a really bulked up gaming pc , do not buy this",0.0
